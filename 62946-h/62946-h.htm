<div style='margin-bottom:1em;'>CONTENTS</div>
</div>
<div class='sc'>Chapter I—<a href='#chI'>A Mystery of the Night</a>
</div>
<div style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em; margin-right:2em; margin-left:2em'>

<p style='text-indent:0'>“There is peril in the air,” warns the guide. Overlanders take flight.
Emma says the suspense is killing her. “The worst is yet to come,”
promises Stacy Brown. Threatened by a forest fire. The Overland Riders
hasten to the relief of imperilled villagers.</p>

</div>
<div class='sc'>Chapter II—<a href='#chII'>In the Demon’s Grip</a>
</div>
<div style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em; margin-right:2em; margin-left:2em'>

<p style='text-indent:0'>Inhabitants of Silver Creek deride Ham White’s warning. Aroused at last.
The fire demon roars. Miss Briggs narrowly escapes. “The fire is yonder!
Work, you thick-heads!” A woman’s scream starts a panic among the
villagers.</p>

</div>
<div class='sc'>Chapter III—<a href='#chIII'>A Rain of Fire</a>
</div>
<div style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em; margin-right:2em; margin-left:2em'>

<p style='text-indent:0'>Ham White directs the fire-fighters. Great tongues of flame. The panic
increases. Grace urges village women to the creek. Danger in the water.
Elfreda Briggs is carried away on the current. Land at last. The
Overland girl utters a thrilling cry.</p>

</div>
<div class='sc'>Chapter IV—<a href='#chIV'>The Lost Cabin</a>
</div>
<div style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em; margin-right:2em; margin-left:2em'>

<p style='text-indent:0'>The village is saved. Overland horses are missing. “Run, girls! Run!”
cries Grace. Ham White is excited. Searching parties are organized. Emma
concerned for her “Hamilton.” Another member of the Overland party is
missing. “Help! I’m dying!” groans Elfreda’s caller.</p>

</div>
<div class='sc'>Chapter V—<a href='#chV'>A Fruitless Quest</a>
</div>
<div style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em; margin-right:2em; margin-left:2em'>

<p style='text-indent:0'>Overland girls search the village for their missing companions. Ham
White hears more bad news. The guide fears the worst. “There is another
peril!” Only the lieutenant knows that one of his party has slipped away
looking for the missing.</p>

</div>
<div class='sc'>Chapter VI—<a href='#chVI'>Facing a New Peril</a>
</div>
<div style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em; margin-right:2em; margin-left:2em'>

<p style='text-indent:0'>The wounded prospector tells his story. “Oh, you poor man,” cries
Elfreda Briggs. “They shot me for gold!” A grave duty to perform. Miss
Briggs’ legacy. Sam Petersen’s horse hidden. Mountain bandits pay a
visit to Lost Cabin.</p>

</div>
<div class='sc'>Chapter VII—<a href='#chVII'>The Discovery</a>
</div>
<div style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em; margin-right:2em; margin-left:2em'>

<p style='text-indent:0'>“Hawk Murray!” breathes Elfreda Briggs. The Overland girl keeps her
nerve. Ready to defend herself. Startled by the return of a bandit.
“Lady, what about the saddle over there in the brush?” he asks. Elfreda
in the toils. A strange thing happens.</p>

</div>
<div class='sc'>Chapter VIII—<a href='#chVIII'>Stacy Takes a Hand</a>
</div>
<div style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em; margin-right:2em; margin-left:2em'>

<p style='text-indent:0'>“I’ll show you you can’t steal my beans and fish!” howls the fat boy.
Stacy proves himself a hero. Mysterious shots put the caller to flight.
“They’ve shot him!” cried the girl. A voice from the shadows of the Lost
Cabin. An amazing disappearance.</p>

</div>
<div class='sc'>Chapter IX—<a href='#chIX'>Mysteries Multiply</a>
</div>
<div style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em; margin-right:2em; margin-left:2em'>

<p style='text-indent:0'>The journey to Silver Creek begun. Stacy helps himself to beans. The
welcome home. “Lost River” an Indian legend. Words fail the fat boy.
Miss Briggs confides in Grace. Elfreda’s gold turns to stone. Sam
Petersen’s diary whisked from Grace Harlowe’s hand.</p>

</div>
<div class='sc'>Chapter X—<a href='#chX'>The Man from Seattle</a>
</div>
<div style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em; margin-right:2em; margin-left:2em'>

<p style='text-indent:0'>“Hands up!” Peanuts are great civilizers. Overlanders regard their guest
with suspicion. Emma makes the fat boy laugh. “Just another mystery.”
“Now who are you, and what is your game?” demands Ham White sternly.
Stalked by a shadow. “Quick! Something has happened to Elfreda!”</p>

</div>
<div class='sc'>Chapter XI—<a href='#chXI'>Believers in Safety First</a>
</div>
<div style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em; margin-right:2em; margin-left:2em'>

<p style='text-indent:0'>Guns bang and Stacy lies low. Struck on the head. “I felt a hand under
my pillow,” explains Miss Briggs. The guide is disturbed. Emma offers to
“demonstrate” for him. Stacy alarmed for his trousers. Jim Haley makes a
mysterious disappearance.</p>

</div>
<div class='sc'>Chapter XII—<a href='#chXII'>A Successful Experiment</a>
</div>
<div style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em; margin-right:2em; margin-left:2em'>

<p style='text-indent:0'>Elfreda’s experience leaves her pale. More than one man involved in the
attack. White finds a trail of blood. Stacy Brown votes himself the
cross of war. The fat boy up to mischief. Another shadow stalks the
Overland tents. A near panic in the camp.</p>

</div>
<div class='sc'>Chapter XIII—<a href='#chXIII'>The Camp is Invaded</a>
</div>
<div style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em; margin-right:2em; margin-left:2em'>

<p style='text-indent:0'>Bears on the rampage. Ponies snort in fright. “We’ve got them going!”
cries Ham White. Havoc worked by marauding beasts. One bear is killed.
Stacy confesses that he called the bears. The savagery of Nature let
loose. “They are coming! Move cautiously.”</p>

</div>
<div class='sc'>Chapter XIV—<a href='#chXIV'>The Battle of the Beasts</a>
</div>
<div style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em; margin-right:2em; margin-left:2em'>

<p style='text-indent:0'>Howls are mingled with snarls. Coyotes attack the dead bear. Wolves add
to the uproar. A sight that thrilled. The battle brief. Grace takes a
shot and misses. Stacy downs a lion. Slinking forms stalk the ponies.
Beady for trouble. A wounded man staggers into camp.</p>

</div>
<div class='sc'>Chapter XV—<a href='#chXV'>A Rude Awakening</a>
</div>
<div style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em; margin-right:2em; margin-left:2em'>

<p style='text-indent:0'>“It’s Jim Haley!” exclaims the guide. The mountain ruffians wanted
peanuts. White refuses to double-cross the Overlanders. Ham White sees
the “Forest Eyes.” The old prospector’s secrets studied. Interrupted by
an intruder. “Who says a woman can’t throw a stone?”</p>

</div>
<div class='sc'>Chapter XVI—<a href='#chXVI'>Bandits Take Their Toll</a>
</div>
<div style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em; margin-right:2em; margin-left:2em'>

<p style='text-indent:0'>Hippy and the guide search for a prowler. Guarding the camp. An
Overlander is missing. An anxious watch. The search abandoned. Nora
reassured by the guide. Ham White admits that he has made a discovery.
“Stacy Brown has been forcibly removed!” is the startling announcement.</p>

</div>
<div class='sc'>Chapter XVII—<a href='#chXVII'>A Test of Courage</a>
</div>
<div style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em; margin-right:2em; margin-left:2em'>

<p style='text-indent:0'>Two Overland Riders now missing. Hamilton White is apprehensive. An
all-night vigil. The guide sends wigwag signals in the early morn.
“Great danger to both!” Grace Harlowe reads the fluttering message. A
girl’s clever strategy. “Hamilton White, I have you now!”</p>

</div>
<div class='sc'>Chapter XVIII—<a href='#chXVIII'>The Flaming Arrow</a>
</div>
<div style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em; margin-right:2em; margin-left:2em'>

<p style='text-indent:0'>Hippy finds himself in the toils. Visited by his captors. “Keep quiet
and listen to me!” warns a hoarse voice. A long and trying hike. The
Overlander restored to his friends. “Isn’t that just like a man!” A
guest who is doubly welcome. A flaming messenger drops into camp.</p>

</div>
<div class='sc'>Chapter XIX—<a href='#chXIX'>His Fate in the Balance</a>
</div>
<div style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em; margin-right:2em; margin-left:2em'>

<p style='text-indent:0'>A letter from Stacy. The fat boy to “be shot at sunrise.” In the hands
of desperate men. A sudden flash lights up Tom Gray’s eyes. Bandits’
demands are met. The guide takes a hurried departure. A mysterious
mission. “It isn’t safe to say a word.”</p>

</div>
<div class='sc'>Chapter XX—<a href='#chXX'>“I’m Shot!” Cries Emma</a>
</div>
<div style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em; margin-right:2em; margin-left:2em'>

<p style='text-indent:0'>Tom leads in the long night journey. Battle sounds in the air. Grace
makes a pleasing discovery. A warning against the mountain bandits. The
Overland party awakened by the crash of a rifle. The camp in confusion.
Emma Dean falls a victim.</p>

</div>
<div class='sc'>Chapter XXI—<a href='#chXXI'>Stacy Seeks a Change</a>
</div>
<div style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em; margin-right:2em; margin-left:2em'>

<p style='text-indent:0'>Carried away on a horse. In the hands of rough men. The fat boy forced
to write a letter. His bluff is called. Bandits hear bad news. Stacy
takes advantage of his opportunity.</p>

</div>
<div class='sc'>Chapter XXII—<a href='#chXXII'>A Strange Visitor</a>
</div>
<div style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em; margin-right:2em; margin-left:2em'>

<p style='text-indent:0'>Emma misses an opportunity to “demonstrate.” A battle is fought over the
Overlanders’ heads. A thrilling duel in the mountain meadow. “Something
terrible is going to happen!” An exhibition of great courage. A bandit’s
career ended.</p>

</div>
<div class='sc'>Chapter XXIII—<a href='#chXXIII'>A Thrilling Discovery</a>
</div>
<div style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em; margin-right:2em; margin-left:2em'>

<p style='text-indent:0'>Cat-foot Charlie arrives. A fallen hero. The arrival at Three Mile Pass.
The key to many mysteries. Sunlight yellows the pass. “Look! Oh, look!”
Grandma and the Children! Elfreda Briggs comes into her own. A final
good-bye to forest and mountain trails.</p>

</div>
<div class='sc'>Chapter XXIV—<a href='#chXXIV'>The House of Happiness</a>
</div>
<div style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em; margin-right:2em; margin-left:2em'>

<p style='text-indent:0'>Overlanders visit Haven Home. A joyous Christmas reunion. Stacy Brown
makes a sensational entrance. The pink and white bundle in the nursery.

</h2>

<p>“Lieutenant! Lieutenant!”</p>

<p>“Eh? Wha—what is it?” muttered Hippy Wingate, rousing himself from a
deep sleep.</p>

<p>“Listen, Lieutenant! There is peril in the air,” answered Ham White. “I
don’t know where it is, but I do know there is trouble afoot, and that
instant action is necessary. I don’t think it advisable to let the
others of our party know, so long as there probably is no immediate
danger.”</p>

<p>“Humph! You men of the forest make me weary. Everything is a mystery—a
peril and so forth and so on. Ham, you’re a good fellow, but you remind
me of Tom Gray—always looking for trouble. What is the big idea?”</p>

<p>Hamilton White placed his lips to Hippy’s ear and whispered. A little
distance from them the camp was sleeping soundly. Not a sound disturbed
the forest night save the faint whisperings of the tree-tops and the
occasional twitter of a bird high up among the branches.</p>

<p>“You don’t say!” exclaimed Hippy, sitting up awake and thoroughly on the
alert. “Are you positive?”</p>

<p>“Yes. It may be a matter of hours; then again minutes may cover the
time.”</p>

<p>“What shall we do?” questioned Hippy.</p>

<p>“Move at once,” answered the guide with emphasis. “We will lay our
course to the northeast and get as far away from here as possible in the
shortest possible time. We’ve got to break camp now, Lieutenant!”</p>

<p>Hippy Wingate sprang to his feet and began dressing. While doing so he
asked how they were to explain their hurried departure to the others of
the party, unless the whole truth were told. White said he would attend
to that.</p>

<p>Hippy shook his head.</p>

<p>“Ham, you have the Overland Riders sized up wrong. They aren’t
tenderfeet, not by a long shot, nor are they shying at danger any more
than you are,” declared Hippy with some heat.</p>

<p>“Turn them out!” ordered Ham. “We can’t afford to waste a moment.”</p>

<p>“All right, Buddy, I’ll turn them out. You will have to do the rest,
though. Turn out, you sleepy-heads!” roared Hippy.</p>

<p>The response was almost instantaneous. The Overland Riders bounced out
of their tents, rubbing their eyes, staggering a little, for they were
not yet fully awake, and demanding to know what had happened. Ham White,
who was already engaged in packing their belongings, paused long enough
to reply.</p>

<p>“Folks, we must break camp and get out of this right smart,” he informed
them.</p>

<p>“What! Lose my night’s sleep?” wailed Stacy Brown. “Move if you wish,
but I stay right here until after breakfast, then I’ll think about
seeking new and more beautiful scenes.”</p>

<p>“Mr. White, will you please tell me why we must break camp at this hour
of the night?” begged Grace Harlowe, stepping over to the guide, and
looking up into his face. “What is it? I know you must have good reason
or—”</p>

<p>“Because, Mrs. Gray, some trouble has developed in the woods, and we are
exposed to it. I don’t wish to alarm you, and for that reason I can’t
explain just now, so please trust to me and don’t urge me to give my
reasons,” answered the guide, resuming his work.</p>

<p>Grace directed a quick glance at the sky, and Elfreda Briggs, now at her
side, did likewise. The stars were clear white, and a light breeze was
stirring the tops of the big pine trees.</p>

<p>“Grace, what do you make of it?” questioned Miss Briggs.</p>

<p>“Nothing, J. Elfreda. Mr. White is an experienced guide, so let’s hustle
and pack for a move.”</p>

<p>Emma Dean, who had dressed hurriedly, was now importuning the guide to
tell her what it was he feared.</p>

<p>“If you will only tell me, I will demonstrate over it, and you will see
how quickly the danger, or whatever it may be, will pass,” she said.</p>

<p>“Pardon me, Miss Dean, I am too busy to talk. Please get yourself ready
for riding as quickly as possible,” replied Mr. White.</p>

<p>“Oh, very well!” Emma elevated her chin and walked away.</p>

<p>“Go on! Demonstrate! I know Ham is willing to try most anything once,”
urged Stacy Brown.</p>

<p>“If Mr. White tried you once, I am quite certain a second trial would be
unnecessary, Stacy,” retorted Emma.</p>

<p>“Wow!” muttered Stacy.</p>

<p>“If my Hippy says it is all right I am satisfied,” spoke up Nora
Wingate, giving Hippy a playful pat as he passed her.</p>

<p>“How demonstrate?” wondered Hippy. “Is this another of your fads? You
have been ‘concentrating,’ ‘reading nature,’ and doing goodness knows
how many other crazy things, on several recent journeys.”</p>

<p>“Mine is not a fad, Hippy,” replied Emma with dignity. “What you call
‘fads’ are simply demonstrations of Truth.”</p>

<p>“Such as Arline Thayer put over on you last year,” chuckled Stacy Brown,
to which Miss Dean deigned no reply.</p>

<p>“It is too bad that poor Arline’s health will not permit her being with
us this year,” murmured Grace.</p>

<p>“Demonstrating,” resumed Emma thoughtfully, “is to breathe in harmony,
permitting no inharmonious thoughts to enter your being.”</p>

<p>“Meaning what?” persisted Hippy Wingate teasingly.</p>

<p>“Meaning, sir, that if you will think hard in the right way, believing
with all your might that certain things will come out as you wish them
to, you will find that they will.”</p>

<p>“Good! I’ll just demonstrate a million dollars into my pocket between
now and morning,” promised Stacy.</p>

<p>Hamilton White gave the Overlanders a quick glance of appraisal, and
nodded to himself. He admitted that perhaps he had not at first formed
the proper estimate of the party he was guiding through the forests and
mountains of the rugged state of Washington. All hands, with the
possible exception of Stacy, began work, and in less than an hour the
camp had been struck and the equipment loaded on the ponies, the embers
of the cook fire having been well soaked with water.</p>

<p>The girls of the party were still trying to solve the mystery of their
hurried departure as they mounted and started away with Mr. White in the
lead. They soon found themselves too fully occupied to give thought to
anything other than to dodging trees and low-hanging limbs, for the
forest was very dark. Hippy Wingate brought up the rear, Stacy Brown in
the middle of the line of riders, grumbling and complaining with every
jolt of the pony, now and then dozing off in his saddle but suddenly
awakening as a tree-trunk scraped his shin or a bough smote him in the
face.</p>

<p>After an hour of uncomfortable riding the guide called a halt, and,
strapping on his climbers, began climbing a tree. He was out of sight in
a few seconds. In the meantime, Grace, gazing up to the skies, noticed
that the stars had now lost their whiteness and had taken on a faded
tint. This puzzled her. She did not know how to interpret the change,
unless, perhaps, it was caused by fog.</p>

<p>“Did you solve the mystery, Mr. White?” called Emma in her sweetest
voice as the guide stepped to the ground and began removing his
climbers, for Emma had already attached herself to Hamilton White as a
man worth while. “What did you discover?”</p>

<p>“Principally atmosphere, Miss Dean,” was the noncommittal reply.</p>

<p>“I think you are real mean,” pouted Emma. “I am angry with you. Some
persons think it is clever to make a mystery of everything, and—”</p>

<p>“Oh, demonstrate over it,” advised Stacy wearily. “It’s only
light-headed persons who thus reason.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! That accounts for some of your peculiarities,” Emma came back
quickly. By this time the Overlanders were laughing over the sparring of
Emma Dean and Stacy Brown.</p>

<p>“Please get under way,” directed the guide, vaulting into his saddle.
Grace and Elfreda took up positions behind him, and the journey through
the somber forest again began. It continued on until about an hour
before daybreak, when, in the faint light, the two girls observed the
guide moisten a finger on his lips and hold it up, slowly turning the
finger from side to side.</p>

<p>Grace wondered, and did the same several times, observed questioningly
by her companion.</p>

<p>“What is it?” whispered Miss Briggs.</p>

<p>“I—I’m not certain,” answered Grace a little lamely.</p>

<p>“This suspense is killing me,” cried Emma, joining the two girls.
“Unless my curiosity is gratified, I surely shall expire.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you do what you threatened to do, demonstrate over the
situation?” demanded Elfreda laughingly.</p>

<p>“Hamilton doesn’t like me to,” returned Miss Dean flushing.</p>

<p>“So? That is the way the wind blows,” chuckled Elfreda, and the girls
laughed heartily.</p>

<p>“Hamilton!” murmured Grace. “It seems to me that matters are progressing
rather rapidly, Emma dear. Here we have been out less than two days on
our annual vacation in the saddle, and you are calling our handsome
guide by his first name. I am amazed at you. I—”</p>

<p>Ham White threw up a hand as a signal that they were to halt. Day was
dawning, and the waving plumes of the tall pines were now quite plainly
visible from below.</p>

<p>“Stop here and take a light breakfast. Better not unpack anything. I
will be back in a few minutes,” said the guide. “These are orders,” he
flung back over his shoulder as he rode rapidly away.</p>

<p>“It seems to me that our guide is rather bossy,” observed Nora Wingate.</p>

<p>“He isn’t!” protested Emma indignantly. “He is the finest man I ever
knew.”</p>

<p>The others looked at each other and burst out laughing; then they began
teasing Emma as they ate breakfast standing beside their ponies. Mr.
White returned ere they had finished their light meal. A quick,
comprehensive glance showed him that his orders had been obeyed.</p>

<p>“You people think me an alarmist, I know, but the fact is I did not wish
to alarm you until I was certain. Now that I have been able to get a
clear observation, I know.”</p>

<p>“The worst is yet to come,” grumbled Stacy.</p>

<p>“Yes. You always bring this outfit bad luck,” retorted Emma.</p>

<p>“Please, please, children!” begged Grace. “What is it, Mr. White?”</p>

<p>“We are in the direct path of a forest fire!”</p>

<p>There followed a moment’s silence, then Hippy spoke up.</p>

<p>“What is the chance of our getting away from it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I am coming to that, and—”</p>

<p>“Then the question seems to be, how much time have we to get out of the
way of this fire?” questioned Grace.</p>

<p>The guide said that neither he nor any one else could answer that
question.</p>

<p>“A forest fire is a sneaking demon,” he declared. “Sometimes one sees no
fire at all, then again it seems as if the whole universe were ablaze.
As a rule, persons who are caught in forest fires never realize it until
the fire has leaped upon them. This fire, so far, is the kind you do
see. Look up!”</p>

<p>All eyes were turned upwards. They saw that the sky was covered with a
yellow haze. The haze seemed low. Birds were winging their way
northward, flying swiftly, and there were rustlings farther out in the
forest, and sounds of unseen creatures hurrying.</p>

<p>“I wish Tom were here,” breathed Grace. Tom Gray, her much-loved
husband, now a well-known forestry engineer, was somewhere off in that
vast forest, making a survey for the government. Grace uttered a fervent
prayer for his safety.</p>

<p>“I believe the fire is still some hours away, but the breeze is in our
direction, and bids fair to hold all day. By striking off to the
eastward and making good time, we have an excellent chance of getting to
higher rocky ground where we shall probably be safe,” was the guide’s
prediction.</p>

<p>“<i>Alors!</i> Let’s go,” urged J. Elfreda Briggs, with a touch of her
old-time lightness of spirit.</p>

<p>“That is what I am getting at. I can direct you so that you folks ought
to make it, but I dislike leaving you,” added Mr. White.</p>

<p>“Leaving us!” exclaimed Emma.</p>

<p>“Yes. More than half a day’s ride from here is a village, a forest
mountain village, with women and children, who, perhaps, will never know
their peril until too late. It is known as Silver Creek, named from the
stream that flows through it, a stream that for about half of the year
is a swollen torrent—water icy cold, coming from the mountain peaks in
the north. In any event, they will need help, and it is my duty to get
there as quickly as possible. Lieutenant, will you take it upon yourself
to lead your party to safety, and let me go on?”</p>

<p>“That—that is for the girls to answer,” replied Hippy gravely, turning
to Grace and her companions.</p>

<p>“Help will be needed at Silver Creek, you think, Mr. White?” questioned
Grace.</p>

<p>“Yes. All they can get.”</p>

<p>“Girls, I think we, too, know where our duty lies, do we not?” she asked
evenly.</p>

<p>“Yes!” was the quick reply from Elfreda and Nora and Emma.</p>

<p>“We are going with you, Mr. White,” announced Grace.</p>

<p>“Oh, help!” wailed Stacy.</p>

<p>A moment later the Overland party was riding at top speed, following
closely on the heels of the guided pony, knowing that upon their speed
in reaching their destination many lives might depend.</p>

</h2>

<p>“Whew! The weather is getting hotter and hotter up here!” exclaimed
Stacy, fanning himself with his sombrero as they trotted along. “Does it
always get this way up here?”</p>

<p>“Sometimes,” answered the guide, with a grim smile.</p>

<p>The others of the party who saw the smile understood.</p>

<p>“Hamilton, you don’t mean it is the heat coming from the forest that we
feel, do you?” questioned Miss Dean.</p>

<p>The guide nodded and urged his pony ahead at a more rapid pace. The
others were keeping up a continual chatter, laughing and joking, and Ham
White wondered if they fully realized the peril that was stalking them.
Mr. White did not yet know the young people he was guiding. Nor did they
know him, which fact Elfreda Briggs voiced when she spoke to Grace on
the subject as they were jogging along.</p>

<p>“There is something about Mr. White that I can’t interpret,” she said.</p>

<p>“And that is?” demanded Grace, regarding her companion with twinkling
eyes.</p>

<p>“That is just it; I don’t know. I do know that Emma has an awful crush
on him, though I am positive that Mr. White doesn’t know it.”</p>

<p>“It is nothing new with Emma, is it?” answered Grace laughingly. “Let me
see, how many men has the dear girl been in love with since we went to
France for war work with our college unit?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I lost the count a long time ago. What is that?”</p>

<p>“Snow. Look at the snow!” shouted Stacy, pointing to a shower of white
flakes that was sifting down over them.</p>

<p>“Oh, it can’t be possible!” wondered Nora Wingate.</p>

<p>“Yes, snow, and the temperature a hundred in the shade,” declared Stacy.
“This is a fine climate. I feel cooler just at sight of those beautiful
white flakes.”</p>

<p>“What is it, Ham?” called Hippy.</p>

<p>“Ashes!” answered the guide. “Ride hard!”</p>

<p>The Overlanders understood now. It was ashes from the forest fire that
was following on their trail, and no further urging was necessary to
keep them going as fast as they could force their horses. In a short
time they were free from the feathery shower and the air seemed fresher,
though they occasionally caught a faint odor of smoke. The Overlanders
felt a certain relief, believing that they had thrown off their pursuer,
but Hamilton White felt no such assurance. That taint of smoke told him
more than the shower of ashes had told him. It meant that the fire was
creeping rather than blazing high, and he knew that a creeping forest
fire was a much to be dreaded enemy. One never knew when or where to
look for it, and it had an uncanny habit of swooping down on one when
least looked for, and devouring. Ham increased his pace.</p>

<p>No stop had been made in that long ride, except once to let the sweating
ponies drink from a cold mountain stream, and about mid-afternoon the
guide called back that they were nearing Silver Creek village. The party
caught their first glance at the creek, whose shining surface indicated
that it had been well named. It was silvery, but ere they had followed
it long, little waves of mud-colored water were leaping up.</p>

<p>There had been a severe storm in the mountains within a day, and the
flood was pouring down on its way to the lowlands. It was soon roaring
so loudly that they had to shout to make themselves heard.</p>

<p>Then the village suddenly burst upon them, a settlement of several
hundred people, with stores and a post office that got its mail twice a
week by a post rider.</p>

<p>The party of riders as they entered the village attracted the entire
attention of the inhabitants, who gathered about, and regarded the
newcomers closely.</p>

<p>“Got anything to eat in this burg?” demanded Stacy Brown, slipping from
his saddle and grinning at the villagers.</p>

<p>“Reckon ye can git something at the store,” answered someone.</p>

<p>“Then me for the store!”</p>

<p>Stacy left his pony and ambled into the general store, where Ham White
and Hippy already had gone. White was just greeting the postmaster, who
owned the place, as Stacy entered.</p>

<p>“Forest fire?” jeered the postmaster, in reply to the guide’s warning.
“Never had any such thing at Silver Creek—never expect to. Creek yonder
will stop any forest fire that ever sprung a spark. Look at it! Listen
to it! I reckon you’ve—”</p>

<p>“Stop it!” commanded White sternly. “I demand the help of the villagers,
and if they don’t make haste this town will be wiped out before they get
started.”</p>

<p>Stacy helped himself liberally from the cracker barrel, listening
wide-eyed to the conversation. So long as the crackers held out he was
well satisfied to have the men talk and keep the storekeeper occupied.</p>

<p>“Who be ye?” demanded the man.</p>

<p>“I am the guide of this party, and—” Ham whispered to the storekeeper.</p>

<p>“Eh? Oh, well, if that’s the case I reckon we’ve got to go through the
motions of stopping a fire that ain’t. What do ye propose to do?”</p>

<p>“Call these people together and tell them to get their axes and begin to
fell trees around the village. I will tell them which ones to cut. Then
I want them to help us backfire the grass around the village; get out
every pail and pan in the place. If there are any barrels here, fill
them with water. Cut boughs to whip out the fire and keep it from
getting away from us while we are backfiring. My party will help. Have
you seen any rangers here within a day or so?”</p>

<p>“No. Bud Carver was passing through about a week ago, and he said—”</p>

<p>“Never mind what he said. Get out and tell those people what they are to
do—”</p>

<p>White was interrupted by a growl from the storekeeper, who had grabbed
Stacy by the collar and separated him from the cracker barrel.</p>

<p>“Here, ye young thief—”</p>

<p>“Don’t you call me a thief!” protested Stacy. “I am paying for what I
get. I’d have paid in advance, but you were busy and I didn’t want to
interrupt you,” explained the fat boy lamely. “Here’s five cents, and
that is more than the whole barrel is worth. I’ll bet you have had them
here ever since Washington stopped being a territory—in name.”</p>

<p>Uttering a growl, the storekeeper stalked out to the porch and waved the
people to him. Hippy Wingate grasped Stacy by an arm and propelled him
from the store.</p>

<p>“It is fortunate for you, young man, that there was nothing to eat in
the postoffice part of the place, or you would have helped yourself and
got in trouble with the United States Government,” declared Hippy.</p>

<p>The others of the party had led their ponies up to the porch and were
standing beside them, waiting for orders from the guide, each one
listening attentively while the storekeeper told the villagers what
Hamilton White had directed him to say.</p>

<p>A loud laugh followed the remarks.</p>

<p>“Ain’t goin’ to burn no grass ’round here! That’s stock grass fer the
cows and the hosses next winter,” warned one.</p>

<p>“The grass is going to be burned, and if you don’t do it we shall do it
ourselves. If we fail, the forest fire will do it and take in the
village at the same time,” warned the guide.</p>

<p>“Show me a forest fire and I’ll think about it,” demanded the man.</p>

<p>“You have a nose. Can’t you smell it?” retorted Hippy Wingate.</p>

<p>The villager laughed.</p>

<p>“That smoke is from a bush fire on Bald Mountain where a feller is
clearing a pa’cel of ground fer a cabin,” jeered the villager.</p>

<p>“The breeze doesn’t happen to be blowing from the direction of Bald
Mountain, my man,” reminded White. “It is coming from the opposite
direction. If you will use your brains, provided you have any, you will
find that the air from the south on your face is hotter by several
degrees than it is from the other direction. Get your axes and the other
things that Mr. Skinner has for us.”</p>

<p>Still unconvinced, the man shook his head, and refused.</p>

<p>“Tie your horses, Overlanders! We will backfire ourselves,” called
White.</p>

<p>“Ye’ll get a charge of buckshot in yer carcass if ye do!” threatened the
mountaineer.</p>

<p>“Try it!” suggested Ham White, giving the man a long, steady look in the
eyes. The protesting villager melted away.</p>

<p>At White’s direction, the storekeeper got out all the pails in his
store, which, together with axes and grub-hoes, were cast out on the
porch.</p>

<p>“You ladies must keep back out of the way,” directed Ham.</p>

<p>“We shall do our part, Mr. White,” answered Grace. “Give us something to
do.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” answered the guide after slight hesitation. “You may fill
all these pails with water and distribute them along the edge of the
village on the north side.”</p>

<p>Boughs, green and tough, were quickly cut by White, who then directed
Hippy to start backfiring, which means firing towards the approaching
forest fire, the start of which is always a risk—the risk of its getting
away and burning that which the fire fighters are seeking to protect.
Only a small section at the edge of the forest was fired at first, Ham
White standing guard with Stacy, ready to leap to the danger point if a
blaze should begin creeping towards the village.</p>

<p>Not a villager lifted a hand to assist, but loud protests were voiced
when the pungent smoke from the burning grass settled over them.</p>

<p>“You will be in luck if you swallow nothing worse than smoke,” Ham White
flung back at them.</p>

<p>There was something in this lithe, upstanding man of the forest that
held the villagers back from taking matters into their own hands and
driving the intruders from the place. He was everywhere, directing Hippy
where to fire, advising the girls where to pour water, prodding Stacy
Brown to keep that worthy from sitting down and shirking his share of
the labor.</p>

<p>Perspiration was standing out on every face, and every face was red from
the heat of the flames that were rapidly eating their way towards the
big trees in the background. Ham White wanted to fell those trees, but
he could not do it alone, nor would the villagers do it for him, so he
did what could be done, and was glad that he had such ready workers as
the Overland Riders proved themselves to be. They were resourceful, too,
and soon understanding what the guide was seeking to accomplish, went to
it without further instruction.</p>

<p>“Miss Briggs!” he called, and Elfreda was at his side in a moment.</p>

<p>“What is it, Mr. White?”</p>

<p>“You are a level-headed woman—”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” answered Elfreda smilingly, mopping the perspiration on her
face into sooty streaks.</p>

<p>“I wish you would go around the right-hand side of this burn. The smoke
is blowing towards us now, so you will get little odor from it. Go into
the forest a little way and watch and listen and sniff. Watch the
ground, not the sides. Any indications of fire that you discover, hear
or smell, let me know instantly.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. White. Carrying water is not particularly inspiring. I
am glad to do something that will occupy me more absorbingly. How shall
I get back here if you fire the right-hand side you just mentioned?”</p>

<p>“This side will be burned off by then, but don’t stand in one spot many
seconds at a time when crossing it. You might burn your feet. Be careful
that you don’t get lost. I trust you to take care of yourself.”</p>

<p>For a few brief seconds they held each other’s eyes, then Elfreda turned
and walked briskly away.</p>

<p>“Please, Hamilton, won’t you come back out of danger,” begged Emma,
slipping an arm through his at this juncture. “I am terribly nervous,
but I am demonstrating for you with every fiber of my being.”</p>

<p>“Go demonstrate on the villagers—do something worth while,” advised
Stacy sourly.</p>

<p>“I will after this is finished—I’ll demonstrate over you,” retorted
Emma.</p>

<p>The guide made no reply, but turned back to his work. Elfreda had
already disappeared from sight. Hers was a responsible post, and none
knew that so well as Hamilton White himself, though Elfreda began to
realize it when she found herself alone in the forest. With every sense
on the alert, Elfreda devoted herself to following Mr. White’s
instructions. She could catch faint whiffs of smoke from the south, but
could see no fire. At first, she thought the odor was from their own
backfire, but after a little she was able to distinguish a difference in
the odor coming from the south. It was more pungent, more overpowering,
seeming to possess more substance, more body, than did the faint smoke
from the grass fire that reached her nostrils.</p>

<p>“I wonder if I had better run back and report? No. I will stay here
until I have something definite. I may be imagining.”</p>

<p>Elfreda was now so far back in the forest that she could not hear the
crackling of the grass backfire that Ham White had started, and she
could but faintly hear the flow of Silver Creek. Soon a few scattering
“snowflakes” began falling about her, and from the previous experience
she knew what these meant. There was fire to the south, though it might
be many miles away. Elfreda was not sufficiently familiar with forest
fires to interpret these indications with certainty.</p>

<p>A low, rumbling noise, that might have been distant thunder, caused her
to listen attentively.</p>

<p>“It might have been a train,” she murmured, then instantly recalled that
there was no railway within fifty miles.</p>

<p>A breeze sprang up from the south and the tops of the trees bent under
it ever so little. Then suddenly Elfreda Briggs witnessed a sight that,
for the instant, paralyzed her—that prevented her from moving a muscle.</p>

<p>What, at first sight, looked to be a shining serpent, was wriggling
toward her, now and then breathing a little spurt of smoke. The
“serpent” disappeared, and she then saw others, all wriggling, twisting,
turning, disappearing, and suddenly appearing in another spot a few
yards away.</p>

<p>“Merciful heaven, what is it?” cried the Overland girl.</p>

<p>A little pine tree, not more than two yards in height, suddenly became
the victim of one of these shining “serpents” and burst into crackling
flames and was consumed in a few minutes.</p>

<p>“Fire!” cried the watcher. Elfreda turned, startled, and fled towards
the “burn” that her companions had made.</p>

<p>They saw her coming on fleet feet. Hamilton White waved to her to keep
to the right, for the grass was still holding fire on the course she was
following, but Elfreda took the gesture for a wave of welcome, and waved
back. In the next second she saw the guide running towards her, followed
by Grace.</p>

<p>Elfreda darted ahead, and was nearly at the edge of the burn when she
came up with them. To her amazement, the guide picked her up, then threw
her flat on the ground. He rolled her over and over in the blackened
ashes of the grass, Grace assisting by vigorous pats, for Elfreda’s
skirt had caught fire.</p>

<p>The blaze was out in a moment, and now the girl began to feel the sting
of burns. Assisted to her feet Elfreda was a sight, her face, neck and
arms black, little patches of white showing here and there, accentuating
the blackness of the rest.</p>

<p>“Quick, take her somewhere and look her over. Get oil from the store and
put on her burns if she has any. Be lively. I—”</p>

<p>“The fiery serpents are there!” gasped Elfreda.</p>

<p>“What!” demanded the guide.</p>

<p>“They’re there, darting all around just beyond the edge of the burn in
the forest. I don’t know—I think—”</p>

<p>“Take her away!” commanded White sternly.</p>

<p>The guide bounded across the burned space and plunged into the forest.
He came back a few moments later, even more rapidly than he had gone
out, never stopping until he reached the store porch.</p>

<p>Something in Hamilton White’s attitude or in his expression silenced the
villagers who had gone into spasms of laughter at Elfreda Briggs’
plight.</p>

<p>“Men, the forest fire is yonder, less than an eighth of a mile away!” he
shouted. “It may not be too late to save the village, but I think it is.
Get your women and children down to the bank of the creek. Bring water
and wet down everything. Work, you thick-heads!” There were murmurs of
objection. A puff of hot air was driven through the village, and a few
moments later a blue haze settled over it. A great silence fell over the
people. It was broken by a woman’s scream.</p>

<p>“Fire!” yelled a man.</p>

<p>“Fire! Fire! Fire!”</p>

<p>The chorus was taken up by a hundred voices, and panic seized upon the
inhabitants of Silver Creek.</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER III</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>A RAIN OF FIRE</span>
</h2>

<p>“Wet down the roofs of all the houses. Keep your heads or you’re
goners!” shouted Ham White.</p>

<p>The Overlanders had grabbed pails and filled them from the creek,
running with them to points where water soon would be needed. Stacy,
however, with his usual disinclination to work, took it upon himself to
boss the villagers, which he did very well. He appeared to be not at all
disturbed by the peril that menaced them.</p>

<p>The sky was now heavily overcast. To add to the gloom, daylight was
fading with the prospect of a night of terror for the people of Silver
Creek. The air grew hot and the pungent odor of smoke sent many into
paroxysms of coughing.</p>

<p>Hamilton White, cool and collected, was giving terse orders here and
there, and working with tireless energy. Hot puffs of wind drove through
the village streets, and that, he knew, was the vanguard of what was to
come.</p>

<p>Men were working under difficulties but to good purpose, for the guide
was directing the work of covering roofs with wet blankets, which were
wet down as fast as water could be brought. The smoke grew more dense,
more suffocating with the moments, and, somewhere off to the south, a
roar like that of an approaching storm was plainly heard. Ham White,
hearing, understood.</p>

<p>“Look! Oh, look!” cried Nora Wingate.</p>

<p>Great tongues of flame were seen leaping into the air high above the
tree-tops of the forest. Sparks and burning embers were now falling in
the village streets. Overhead the air itself seemed to be on fire.
Sheets of flame were curling and rolling through the forest like
breakers on a reef. At one moment the sky would be lighted up
brilliantly, and in the next deep, impenetrable darkness covered all.</p>

<p>The terror of the villagers increased, and the Overland girls, on their
way to and fro for water, did what they could to calm the women, but
without great success. To add to the terror and the peril, the village
was now surrounded with fire on three sides. It seemed to be growing
more threatening with the moments, and the clouds of soot became denser.</p>

<p>“Oh, how terrible!” cried Nora to Grace Harlowe.</p>

<p>“Yes, but one of the most tremendous spectacles I have ever seen,”
answered Grace, whose face, like all others about her, was so black as
to be almost unrecognizable.</p>

<p>In all the excitement, however, the two girls found time to observe and
marvel. They saw streamers of fire appear to die out, and then charge
forward toward the village at race-horse speed, threatening to envelop
and devour it.</p>

<p>The villagers started to run as their panic increased.</p>

<p>“Stay where you are! You are safer here!” Ham White shouted in warning
to all.</p>

<p>Houses were now catching fire, despite all efforts, and men worked in a
frenzy, for, if the fire once got a good start in the village, they now
knew that it would be destroyed. Some of the cooler heads among the
women lent much assistance to the Overlanders, but most of them were too
terrified to give any assistance at all.</p>

<p>“Some of these women surely will perish unless something is done at
once,” said Miss Briggs. “Suggest something, Grace, for the love of
heaven.”</p>

<p>“The creek! Help me herd them down on its bank,” answered Grace with
ready resource. “Nora! You and Emma must assist. Don’t hesitate. Jump to
it! There are men enough to carry water. Lives are of more account than
houses.”</p>

<p>The girls sprang to their task with energy. It was not an easy task to
which they had assigned themselves, and the first of the women sent to
the stream had to be forced there. There were choking protests, but the
Overland girls gave no heed, as there was no time for argument, and
seconds wasted might mean loss of lives.</p>

<p>“If your clothes catch fire, duck into the creek,” was the advice
shouted over and over again to the village women by Grace and her
companions. “Keep close to the shore or you may be swept off your feet
and carried downstream.”</p>

<p>The latter part of the Overlanders’ advice was not heeded in every
instance, and now and then one of the girls found it necessary to haul
ashore some woman who was in danger of being carried away by the
current.</p>

<p>As the heat in the village increased in intensity, shivering women and
children were standing in the creek’s cold waters, protecting themselves
from the burning air by covering their heads with wetted articles of
clothing.</p>

<p>Another peril found them there. Logs, broken, charred tree-limbs, were
rolling and tumbling down with the stream. Something hit Elfreda, who
was dragging a woman to safety, and pushed the girl under. Struggle as
she would, Miss Briggs was unable for some time to extricate herself,
though she did manage to keep her head above water. Her skirts had
caught on the branches of what proved to be the bushy top of a tree, and
she was swept away on the current.</p>

<p>After what seemed hours Elfreda succeeded in freeing herself, and
permitted herself to float while she rested, breathing hard from her
exertions.</p>

<p>The village of Silver Creek had disappeared in the distance. A roaring
sound came to Elfreda’s ears, which she soon discovered was caused by
the rushing current of a turbulent river.</p>

<p>“Mercy! What am I coming to?” cried the girl in her extremity. Elfreda
was frightened, but by no means panic-stricken. “Oh, this surely is the
end!” gasped the girl as she found herself suddenly whirled into wild
waters.</p>

<p>It was Roaring River into which Miss Briggs had been swept from the
creek, and now her last hope seemed gone, for the stream was wide and
full of floating logs and brush, and here and there dark objects brushed
past her. The girl drifted on and on, chilled and exhausted, but still
possessing a strength of will that kept her from letting go, as many
another would have done in her circumstances.</p>

<p>Of how long she had been in the water Elfreda had not the slightest
idea, but it seemed to have been hours, when suddenly she was halted by
the roots of a tree on the bank of the river, from which the dirt had
been washed away.</p>

<p>Grasping at the roots, Miss Briggs clung there resting. After a little
she dragged herself over the roots and finally reached soft yielding
earth.</p>

<p>“Thank God!” breathed Elfreda fervently, and stretching out she sank
into a deep sleep of exhaustion.</p>

<p>When Miss Briggs awakened from that sleep the sun was shining, but there
was a yellow haze in the air, and the odor of smoke was wafted to her on
the morning breeze. Birds were singing in the trees, and the earth
seemed at peace.</p>

<p>“J. Elfreda, you have done it this time!” she rebuked herself. “Why did
you ever go into that terrible water? Oh, what has become of the others?
This will never do. I must do something!” she cried, rousing herself and
standing up to look about her.</p>

<p>What to do, was the perplexing question. It was then that Elfreda
discovered a trail. Trees along the trail had been blazed, but the
blazes were not new. The path had been used frequently, she observed,
and led into the forest. For that the Overland girl was thankful.</p>

<p>After brief reflection, Miss Briggs decided to follow the trail that
Fate had offered to her. It must lead somewhere, she reasoned. Had
Elfreda been more familiar with life in the forest she would have known
that this was either a trapper’s or a fisherman’s trail, but to her all
forest blazes looked alike, so she plodded on slowly, keeping a sharp
lookout for slashes on sides of the trees, and for signs of human
habitation.</p>

<p>When an hour had passed, and the trail still led on, the girl began to
lose heart. She sank down to rest and think, but as she peered
underneath the low-hanging branches of under-brush and saplings, Elfreda
made a discovery that set her pulses beating. There, less than fifty
yards ahead of her, she saw a shack, and about it was a hedge of
evergreens that undoubtedly had been placed there by human hands.</p>

<p>“Saved!” cried Elfreda, springing to her feet, forgetful of the aches
and pains of a few moments before.</p>

<p>The Overland girl caught her breath suddenly, and a rush of color leaped
to her cheeks, for Elfreda Briggs had made another discovery, and with
it came the realization that a most amazing thing had occurred.</p>

<p>Uttering a shrill little cry, Elfreda started forward at a run.</p>

</h2>

<p>“The village is saved!”</p>

<p>Hamilton White, blackened, red-eyed, his clothing scorched, made that
announcement as, at the break of day, he had opportunity to look about
him.</p>

<p>“Yes, and not a life lost,” agreed Grace Harlowe, herself worn out and
disheveled. “It is a miracle. Mr. White, they should get down on their
knees to thank you for what you have done for Silver Creek. Without your
resourcefulness—Well, there would be nothing left of the village or
people.”</p>

<p>“Thank you!” Ham White bowed and grinned through the soot on his face.
“The credit is due wholly to the assistance of the Overlanders. In other
words, the shoe is on the other foot.”</p>

<p>“Well, what next?” demanded Hippy Wingate coming up, Emma Dean
following, and taking her place beside the guide.</p>

<p>“Something to eat if we can find it, then to get out of here and to
dodge what is left of the fire,” replied the guide. “Suppose we go down
to the creek and wash our faces.”</p>

<p>“Get out of here!” jeered Hippy. “With what? I haven’t seen anything
that looked like a horse since yesterday. I think our animals must have
gone downstream, and that we are all fixed for a long hike to some place
where fresh mounts can be had.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Hamilton! Is it really true that the ponies have run away?” begged
Emma, linking arms with the guide.</p>

<p>“Too true, little bird,” chuckled Hippy. “Thank you, Mr. Wingate. Being
a bird is better than being a donkey,” answered Emma.</p>

<p>“And hop from bough to bough, and chatter and then chatter some more,”
finished Hippy.</p>

<p>“While a donkey can only bray, and then bray some more,” was Emma’s
parting shot, which brought a shout of laughter from the begrimed
Overlanders.</p>

<p>Hippy made a gesture of helpless resignation, and turned to the guide to
ask what they had better do.</p>

<p>“We will find the stock somewhere to the northeast, provided they have
been neither burned nor drowned. Stock have an instinct that tells them
to seek high ground,” said the guide. “By the way, is Miss Briggs in one
of the houses resting?”</p>

<p>“Elfreda!” cried Nora.</p>

<p>The girls looked at each other with the same question in their eyes.
None had seen her since the evening before, and in the excitement and
confusion she had not been missed.</p>

<p>“Girls, girls! Run!” cried Grace. “Go to every house in the village. She
must be here! She must be here! Hippy! Mr. White! Please help us.”</p>

<p>There was instant compliance, and half an hour later the Overlanders met
in front of the post office. Grace was the only one of the party that
had any information to convey. Grace had found the woman whom Miss
Briggs had tried to rescue, and ascertained that the last that woman had
seen of her was when Elfreda had given her a vigorous push towards the
shore.</p>

<p>For the first time since the Overlanders had known him, Ham White lost
his composure. He steadied himself in a moment. Leaping to the steps of
the store he shouted to the villagers that were still thronging the
streets.</p>

<p>“Men!” he said. “These splendid young women have helped to save your
town and your women and children. One of the young women, Miss Briggs,
is missing. She <i>must</i> be found, and I want you men to form a searching
party. Get your breakfasts, but never mind anything else. If you are
men, which I believe you to be, you won’t have to be urged. I’ll tell
you what to do. Will you go?”</p>

<p>“Yes!” The answer was a shout. And Hamilton White smiled.</p>

<p>The guide directed the girls to steady themselves, and eat. As for
himself, he wanted nothing to eat except what he could carry with him
and munch on his way. White sent one searching party down each side of
the creek, heading the party on the left side himself, with Lieutenant
Hippy Wingate leading the party on the right.</p>

<p>“Do not worry if we aren’t back as quickly as you might hope for, as we
shall be looking for stock—for our horses—at the same time,” he urged.</p>

<p>“Oh, Hamilton, do be careful of yourself,” begged Emma as the men were
starting away. “I shall demonstrate for you all the time you are away.”</p>

<p>Grace linked an arm in Emma’s.</p>

<p>“My dear, how long have you known Mr. White?” she asked gently.</p>

<p>“It seems as though I have always known him,” answered Emma dreamily.</p>

<p>“As a matter of fact, you have known him less than a week. It is true we
took him on the recommendation of the banker at Cresco, where we made
our start for the Cascade Range of Washington State, and we know him to
be a man of intelligence, a brave, resourceful fellow, but there is
still something about him that I do not understand. I don’t believe he
is what he represents himself to be, but, if we should ever go out
again, he is the man I should like to have lead us. Just the same, that
is no reason why you should be so forward. Emma, well-bred girls are not
supposed to wear their hearts on their sleeves. Be a good fellow, which
you are, but be dignified,” admonished Grace smilingly.</p>

<p>“I am and I do,” answered Miss Dean haughtily.</p>

<p>“Now let us forget our little lecture, and do what we can to assist the
women of the village to get set, so to speak,” suggested Grace. “We must
not worry about Elfreda. I believe we shall find her and that she is as
safe at this moment as we are.”</p>

<p>“I’ll demonstrate over her. I’ll keep saying to myself, ‘Elfreda is well
and happy. No harm can come to her because only error can mean harm,’”
promised Emma, bubbling and laughing.</p>

<p>“Come,” said Grace. “Demonstrate after we have given some material aid
to these distressed people.”</p>

<p>It was about this time that Elfreda reached the shack in the forest and
made the discovery that so startled her. Elfreda’s amazement was caused
by the sight of a human being, sitting on a stump near the shack. The
human being was short and fat. He was eating from a can of baked beans,
his big eyes regarding Miss Briggs soulfully, his cheeks puffed out with
the beans.</p>

<p>“Stacy!” cried Elfreda. “Oh, Stacy Brown! Am I dreaming?”</p>

<p>“Mebby,” mumbled the fat boy, digging more beans from the can.</p>

<p>Elfreda ran to him, and in her joy at seeing her Overland companion, she
threw her arms about Stacy. In doing so she knocked the can of beans
from his hands, and the rest of the contents was spilled on the ground.</p>

<p>“Now see what you’ve done,” wailed the fat boy. “And the beanery fifty
miles away.”</p>

<p>“Never mind the beans. What is this place?”</p>

<p>“Lost cabin,” answered Stacy promptly.</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>“I don’t. I just guessed it. Hungry?”</p>

<p>“Famished,” answered J. Elfreda.</p>

<p>“Some more canned stuff under the floor of the shack,” he informed her,
waving a hand towards the cabin, and picking up the spilled beans one by
one, placing each individual bean carefully in his mouth.</p>

<p>“First tell me how you got here?” demanded Miss Briggs.</p>

<p>“Came down on a Roaring River Liner—other words, a log. Where’s the
party?”</p>

<p>“Trying to put out the fire at Silver Creek. Shall we try to find our
way back?”</p>

<p>“What! With all that food cached in the shack?” demanded Stacy almost
indignantly. “So long as the food holds out and no fire comes along, I
stay right here. I know a good thing when I find it. After I get enough
to keep my strength up I am going down to the river and catch some fish.
Then we will have a real spread.”</p>

<p>“Hopeless!” exclaimed Elfreda. “I am glad to see you, though. I think
you are right about remaining here for the day. When the fire is under
control our folks will search for us, and Mr. White will pick up our
trail.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I left ‘feetprints’ in the river when the log rolled me off. Did
you ever observe how wonderfully prominent ‘feetprints’ in the water
are, Elfreda?”</p>

<p>Elfreda gave her head a toss and walked to the cabin. It was a typical
forest shack. There was a plain deal table, two chairs, a bed on the
floor and blankets hung over a line. The dishes were limited, but
sufficient for one or two persons. She investigated an opening in the
floor, from which Stacy had lifted the trap door, and found there a good
supply of canned goods, some rope, axes, picks and shovels.</p>

<p>“A forest ranger’s shack,” she murmured. “Yes, I think that must be it.”
Elfreda helped herself to a can of beans, surveyed it ruefully and
carried it outside.</p>

<p>“Have you the can-opener, Stacy?” she asked.</p>

<p>Stacy shook his head.</p>

<p>“How did you open your cans then?” Several empty cans lay about the
stump on which he was sitting.</p>

<p>“With my teeth. Bit ’em open!” said the fat boy thickly.</p>

<p>“Stacy Brown, you are impossible! I think I know a better way.” Elfreda
got an axe from the shack and attacked the can of beans. She made a bad
job of it, and most of the beans that were not mashed flat were
scattered about on the ground. These, the fat boy gathered up carefully
and placed in his own can.</p>

<p>“Get another can. I’m busy, but I will open it for you. Girls are so
helpless.”</p>

<p>“I am beginning to agree with you,” answered Miss Briggs, returning to
the cabin for another can. When she came back Stacy removed the top of
the can with his knife, and handed the food to her.</p>

<p>“For this, you buy me a new knife when we reach a store somewhere.
Knives cost money, and I can’t afford to waste mine on girls.”</p>

<p>“You shall have a new knife, and thank you very much for your courtesy,”
returned Elfreda.</p>

<p>Stacy gave her a sidelong glance.</p>

<p>“You look all fagged out. After you finish that can, better go in and
lie down. Besides, it won’t do to overload your stomach so soon after a
bath.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you funny boy!” Elfreda laughed until two tear drops were sparkling
on her brown cheeks. “If you will catch some fish I promise to cook them
for you, and we will have a real spread. Yes, I will take a nap, for I
am completely fagged. Did you discover any coffee in the shack?”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh. I didn’t have time to make coffee. I’m too busy to do so now.”</p>

<p>Miss Briggs went to the shack, spread out the blankets for inspection,
and found them clean; so she laid them on the bed and stretched out for
a rest. Until then she had not realized how weary she was, and, in a few
moments, fell into a deep sleep.</p>

<p>After a time Stacy took a nap by the stump, from which he did not awaken
until late in the afternoon. He did not know what time it was, his watch
having stopped on his wet ride from the village of Silver Creek. The fat
boy decided to go fishing. There was a bamboo pole, hook and line in the
shack, and this he got, after taking a squint at the sleeping Elfreda.</p>

<p>“Girls are such sleepy-heads,” muttered the boy, as he shouldered the
pole and went out, making all the noise he could, all of which failed to
awaken Miss Briggs. On the way to the stream he looked for a rotting
stump, one of which he eventually found, and with his hunting knife
managed to dig out some nice white grubs for bait.</p>

<p>“Humph! They do look almost good enough to eat,” he muttered, surveying
some of the grubs in the palm of his hand. “I don’t blame the fish for
liking them.”</p>

<p>Shortly after that the fat boy sat down on the bank with his line in the
water, thoroughly at peace with the world, and content to remain where
he was so long as the food held out.</p>

<p>Stacy had not been fishing long when he heard a horse approaching, but
did not turn his head, his eyes remaining fixed on the fish line that
caused a little ripple in the stream as it split the current.</p>

<p>“Hello, boy!” called a voice behind him.</p>

<p>“Same to you,” returned Stacy.</p>

<p>“Fishing?”</p>

<p>“No. Just teaching this grub how to swim.”</p>

<p>“Say, you! You’re too fresh. I’ve a good mind to throw you into the
river,” growled the newcomer.</p>

<p>“Better not. I’ll get wet.”</p>

<p>“Where do you come from?” demanded the man, his voice sharp and
incisive.</p>

<p>“Up Silver Creek way. I came down here on the river packet to get away
from the forest fire.”</p>

<p>“I mean, where do you live?”</p>

<p>“Right here at the present moment. I don’t look as if I were dead, do
I?”</p>

<p>“You may be soon if you ain’t more civil. What happened to the village?”</p>

<p>“Some people got singed, others got wet. I got a little of both before I
shipped.”</p>

<p>The man got down from his horse and stepped around where he could see
the fat boy’s face. Stacy gave him a slow, sidelong glance, then turned
his attention to his line. He had a bite, and a few seconds later he
landed a fish.</p>

<p>“Huh!” grunted the stranger. “Anybody with you?”</p>

<p>“A few grubs in my pocket and myself, that’s all. Who are you?”</p>

<p>“None of your business!”</p>

<p>Stacy regarded the stranger blinkingly. The fellow was not a
pleasant-looking man, and a scar across one cheek gave him a still more
evil look. The horse he rode, Stacy observed, was a fine animal and
looked as though it could develop a lot of speed.</p>

<p>“Where’d you get the nag?” questioned the boy.</p>

<p>“Bought him. Didn’t think I stole him, did you?” demanded the man
indignantly.</p>

<p>Stacy shrugged his shoulders, but made no reply. He resumed his fishing.</p>

<p>“Let me give you some advice, young fellow. This is no place for
children. You git out of here, and stay out. I’ll be back later, and if
you’re here then I’ll help you out on the run.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” drawled the fat boy without looking up.</p>

<p>The stranger rode away, and Stacy resumed his fishing. He caught a fine
mess of trout; then the grubs gave out. Being too tired to return to the
shack just then the Overlander decided to take a nap, which he proceeded
to do. Night came on, and Stacy Brown was still asleep. So was Elfreda
Briggs, in the shack. Miss Briggs had not moved since she lay down hours
before.</p>

<p>It was late when she finally suddenly roused herself and sat up. The
cabin was enshrouded in darkness. Peering out, she saw that it was
night.</p>

<p>“Stacy!” she called. There was no response. Stacy Brown was sleeping
peacefully on the bank of Roaring River.</p>

<p>Elfreda wondered what had awakened her so suddenly. Then all at once she
understood. She heard a horse approaching. The animal stopped just
beyond the cabin. Miss Briggs did not go to the door, but got to her
feet and listened. She thought she heard someone groan; then all was
silence for a moment.</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed the Overland girl under her breath as the door of the
shack was slowly pushed open. “Who is it?” she cried, with all the
steadiness that she could summon. Miss Briggs reached for her revolver,
but it was not in its holster.</p>

<p>A man staggered in. She could see his figure faintly outlined in the
doorway.</p>

<p>“Help! I’m shot—I’m dying!” groaned the man, and collapsed at the feet
of Elfreda Briggs.</p>

</h2>

<p>“Grace! Oh, Grace!”</p>

<p>After several hours of hard work assisting the women of the village to
untangle the confusion of their homes, the contents of most of which
were in the streets, Nora came running in search of Grace Harlowe.</p>

<p>“What is wrong, Nora?” begged Grace a little fearfully.</p>

<p>“Have you seen Stacy?”</p>

<p>“No. Come to think of it, I have not. Why, I haven’t seen him since last
night, either.”</p>

<p>“Neither has anyone else, so far as I have been able to learn.”</p>

<p>“Are you positive that he did not go out with the men this morning?”
asked Grace.</p>

<p>“They say he did not.”</p>

<p>“Chunky”—as his companions sometimes called him—“is probably asleep
somewhere about,” suggested Emma Dean. “You know what a wonderful
sleeper he is.”</p>

<p>“I doubt it,” answered Grace reflectively. “Was he in the creek?”</p>

<p>Nora said she did not know.</p>

<p>“That makes two of our party that are missing. What are we going to do?”
begged Nora, tears of anxiety springing to her eyes.</p>

<p>“We will search for him in the vicinity of the village. That is all we
can do. If we do not find him we simply shall have to wait until the men
return to-night,” decided Grace.</p>

<p>“If Hamilton were only here he would know what is best,” complained
Emma.</p>

<p>Grace gave her a look of rebuke.</p>

<p>“Mr. White probably will find the boy. He will leave nothing undone, of
that we girls are certain, and we shall have to make the best of a bad
situation, which may not be nearly so bad as it seems,” comforted Grace.
“Come, let us take different directions and search the village and its
immediate vicinity.”</p>

<p>“I have another one to demonstrate over now. I don’t want to demonstrate
over Chunky, but I suppose it wouldn’t be honest not to,” complained
Emma. “This is terrible.”</p>

<p>The girls separated and made a careful search about the village and out
among the trees, as far from the village as they dared to go. There were
still many little smouldering fires, but there was so little for them to
feed upon that they could not spread.</p>

<p>Not a trace of the missing boy did the girls find, though there was
plenty of tragic evidence of the deadly work of the forest fire
everywhere they went. The girls returned, giving up the task.</p>

<p>“We must wait, and go on with our work. It will help to keep our minds
from our worries. My husband would be a great comfort if he were here,
for Tom is ever ready and resourceful,” murmured Grace.</p>

<p>“He is no better than Hamilton,” protested Emma indignantly. “What
Hamilton doesn’t know about everything up here isn’t worth knowing.”</p>

<p>The girls laughed at Emma, who turned away, face flushed and eyes moist.
They busied themselves all the rest of the day, but when night came on,
the searchers had not returned. Shortly after nine o’clock, however, a
shout told the anxious Overlanders that someone was approaching. It
proved to be Hippy Wingate and his party. Hippy reported that they had
not found a trace of Elfreda Briggs. He was shocked when he learned that
Stacy also was missing.</p>

<p>It was an hour later when Hamilton White and his party of searchers came
in. They were leading a bunch of horses.</p>

<p>“We got them all but one, folks,” he cried as the villagers and the
Overlanders crowded about him and his party.</p>

<p>“But Miss Briggs!” wailed Nora Wingate. “Don’t tell me that—”</p>

<p>“She was not found on the left-hand side of the river. We followed
Roaring River down to a point about fifteen miles below here. As you
see, we got all the mounts but one, and that one evidently was swept
away, else he would have been with his mates.”</p>

<p>White was speaking more rapidly than was his wont, and Grace was
regarding him keenly.</p>

<p>“Did you know that Stacy Brown is missing also?” she asked.</p>

<p>The guide regarded her for a moment.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” he murmured. “Don’t be disheartened, Mrs. Gray. To-morrow I
shall take the other side of the river and stay out until I get a
definite line on what has happened. It would have been useless to remain
out longer to-night.”</p>

<p>After a little, when he had answered many questions, White beckoned
Grace aside.</p>

<p>“You are a level-headed woman, Mrs. Gray, so I think it best to tell you
what I have discovered. I—”</p>

<p>“I knew you were keeping something back. Tell me. The truth is better
than the suspense.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t agree with you. I found Miss Briggs’ hat and her
handkerchief on my side of the river. The men with me do not know this.
The current on my side of the stream set into a bend at one point, then
switched over to the right-hand side. That is why I am going down the
right-hand side to-morrow. To me the finding of the hat is proof that
our missing woman was really swept downstream, but my confidence in Miss
Briggs’ cool-headedness is so strong that I believe she found a way to
get out of the river.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” replied Grace quietly. “By the same token, I think we shall
find Stacy. If he succeeds in finding something to eat, he will remain
where the food is until it is exhausted,” she added with a little smile.</p>

<p>“Just so,” agreed the guide. “I am more disturbed about possible peril
to Miss Briggs after she escaped from the river.”</p>

<p>“Meaning what?” demanded Grace.</p>

<p>“That there is danger to the north of us—a peril worse than forest fires
or wild beasts.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes!” urged Grace.</p>

<p>“I mean the Murrays.”</p>

<p>Grace said she never had heard of them.</p>

<p>“They are notorious bandits, cutthroats, robbers, everything that is
vicious. Did Miss Briggs wear any jewels?”</p>

<p>“She did—a diamond ring that is quite valuable, and a jewelled watch
that was presented to her by the French government after she finished
her work there with our college unit in the war.”</p>

<p>“They would kill for less than that!” was the disturbing announcement of
Hamilton White, as he turned abruptly away.</p>

<p>Ham White did not wait until morning to resume his search. After taking
a light supper, and packing some “grub” in his kit bag, he quietly
forded the creek with one of the Overland ponies, then disappeared in
the darkness, headed downstream. Only Lieutenant Hippy Wingate knew that
he had gone. Ham White was headed towards an adventure that proved to be
a thrilling one, both for himself and others.</p>

</h2>

<p>“Sho—Shot!” gasped Elfreda Briggs, as the stranger lay huddled on the
floor where he had fallen. He was breathing heavily, and perhaps it was
this that brought Miss Briggs to herself. After long service with
wounded men in France, she knew what a bullet wound was, and her first
instinct upon recovering from her fright was to give first aid.</p>

<p>Elfreda had found candles and matches in the cabin, and these she
quickly procured, lighting two candles the better to see her patient.
She peered down at her unexpected guest, a long, lean figure, his lined,
unshaven face ashen from pain and weakness. Elfreda instantly recognized
the symptoms.</p>

<p>“Oh, you poor, poor man!” she cried in a voice full of sympathy, and
placed a folded blanket under his head. Then the Overland girl ran out
to a spring just back of the cabin, returning with a basin of cold
mountain water. First giving the wounded man a drink, she tore open the
faded, worn shirt and bathed his wound, which she knew at once was a
serious one.</p>

<p>This served to rouse the patient a little, and he regarded her with
searching eyes—eyes that were full of pain.</p>

<p>“Tha—ank you. You’re a good girl. What be you doing here?”</p>

<p>“I belong to a party, but was carried down the river from Silver Creek
village when the forest fire reached there. Never mind that—tell me
about yourself.”</p>

<p>“The gang got me—Hawk Murray’s gang. Name’s Sam Petersen, and I’m a
prospector—was a prospector, but I’m done, finished now.”</p>

<p>“Why did they shoot you?”</p>

<p>“For gold, Miss, gold! But I hung on to my horse and got away. They’ll
be here.”</p>

<p>Elfreda begged him not to worry, seeing that the thought of the Murray
gang excited him.</p>

<p>“Promise me, for your own sake, that you will not let them find me or
know that I have been here. If they find out they’ll do the same by you
that they have done by Sam Petersen.”</p>

<p>Miss Briggs caressed the gray head, and moistened his lips with the cold
mountain water. Then, as tenderly as possible, she dragged the wounded
man to the bunk at one corner of the room, where he might be more
comfortable.</p>

<p>“It’s mighty good to have you help me, but tain’t no use. I’ve staked my
last claim and—listen!” Petersen roused himself, and a new light flashed
into his eyes. “I must tell you, and I must do it quick. Reach in my
pocket and take out the diary there. Hide it! Left hand po—pocket.
That’s it.”</p>

<p>Elfreda hesitatingly drew forth a well-worn book, the corners of which
were broken down and the leaves swollen from frequent thumbing.</p>

<p>“There’s something else there, too. Take that, too; it’s your’n.”</p>

<p>The Overland girl drew forth a small canvas bag, soiled and worn, and
heavy. It was tied at the neck with a buckskin thong, and at his nod she
opened the bag. She saw a handful of nuggets, some worn and shiny,
water-worn as they proved to be, while at the bottom of the bag was some
dust.</p>

<p>“Gold!” murmured Elfreda Briggs. “Is this why they shot you, Mr.
Petersen?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and for what’s in that diary. Mebby you’ve heard of Lost Mine, a
dried-up water course that the Indians say many years ago was paved with
gold.”</p>

<p>Elfreda shook her head.</p>

<p>“Crazy prospectors like Sam Petersen have been hunting for that mine for
more’n twenty-five years. Sam Petersen found it!” The man’s voice had
dropped to a thrilling whisper. A dead silence followed, broken by the
hoot of an owl near the cabin.</p>

<p>Elfreda shivered a little.</p>

<p>“It’s there in the book—all but how to get there. Hawk Murray and his
gang found out that I’d got this bag of dust and nuggets. They knew I’d
been prospecting for just what they’d been trying for a long time to
find, and they believed I’d found it. Hawk and his bunch trailed me, and
we had a shooting match. I downed one of the gang, but Hawk got me.
Lady, I ain’t a bad man—I’m an honest man, but up here a man’s what he
is, and if he ain’t able to shuffle for himself he’s all set to be
shuffled off one day.”</p>

<p>“You are talking too much—exerting too much effort. Be quiet and rest,”
commanded Elfreda.</p>

<p>“I got to talk. I got to talk fast. I ain’t got much more time. Write
down in the book what I got to say. Ready?”</p>

<p>Miss Briggs nodded. “Lost River, north branch, Grandma and the Children,
three peaks dead east—and there’s the bed of Lost River. In it is gold,
shining gold, the promised land and—it’s yours. I ain’t got no family.”</p>

<p>“I don’t quite understand. Can you make it a little clearer?”</p>

<p>“All yours and—”</p>

<p>“Please don’t talk any more. I want you to rest. You are getting
excited. What is gold compared to a man’s life, Mr. Petersen?”</p>

<p>There was no reply.</p>

<p>Elfreda Briggs glanced at the face, then, leaning over, peered closer.</p>

<p>“Get rid of the horse—shoot him. They’ll be here soon after daylight and
then—”</p>

<p>That was all. The tired old voice trailed off into nothingness. Sam
Petersen had staked his last claim.</p>

<p>Tears trickled down Elfreda’s cheeks. A thin gray bar of daylight was
now creeping across the cabin floor, and with it came the memory of the
old prospector’s warning: “The Murray gang will be here soon after
daylight”—and then—“Get rid of the horse!”</p>

<p>Realizing that perhaps her own life might hang on following Petersen’s
advice, Miss Briggs sprang up and ran out. Standing a few yards from the
cabin, there was a fine bay mare browsing on the tender leaves of the
hedge. The animal regarded her solemnly, and, she thought, with a
friendly approving look.</p>

<p>“You poor horse! Shoot <i>you?</i> I couldn’t do it, but I am going to try to
hide you,” declared the Overland girl.</p>

<p>Gripping the bridle she led the animal off to the right of the cabin
until she reached a stream. Into this she led the animal for some
distance, and secreted him in a narrow pass that was well hidden.</p>

<p>“I think I will take the saddle and hide that,” reflected Elfreda. Upon
second thought she decided to carry it back and hide it near the cabin,
for she recognized it as a fine Mexican saddle. The saddle she did
secrete in a thick growth of bushes about fifty yards from the shack.</p>

<p>As she approached the cabin her footsteps became halting.</p>

<p>“What if they should come and find him here? Oh, this is terrible.
Where, where can Stacy be? Why doesn’t he come back?”</p>

<p>It was not a pleasant task that confronted Elfreda Briggs, but she went
to it with lips set, face pale, and heart beating nervously. She covered
the thin old frame of Sam Petersen, and over it laid the blankets.</p>

<p>“Oh, this is terrible,” moaned the girl, then grew suddenly rigid. The
sound of approaching horses reached her alert ears as she stood in the
middle of the floor, every faculty on the alert.</p>

<p>They galloped up to the shack and halted.</p>

<p>“Hello the cabin!” called a rough voice.</p>

<p>Miss Briggs pinched her cheeks to bring back the color that she knew had
left them, then summoning all her courage she stepped to the door. That
courage almost failed her when she saw before her six of the roughest
looking men she ever had seen. They were mounted on lean, tough horses;
there was a rifle in every saddle boot, and they wore side arms as well.</p>

<p>“The Murrays!” gasped the girl. “Sam Petersen knew whereof he spoke.”</p>

</h2>

<p>“Hawk Murray!” exclaimed Elfreda Briggs, as one of the horsemen rode
around the hedge and up to the door of the cabin. Elfreda recognized the
man by his long hooked nose that really resembled the beak of a hawk. It
was not a pleasant face to look upon.</p>

<p>“Mornin’, Miss,” he greeted, with an attempt at politeness.</p>

<p>“Good morning, sir,” replied Miss Briggs firmly, essaying a smile as she
said it, though she did not feel like smiling, for the eyes of the rider
seemed to be searching her very soul.</p>

<p>“Do ye live here?” was the next question.</p>

<p>“For the present, yes.”</p>

<p>“Ye don’t reckon ye’ve seen a stranger on a bay mare passin’ here this
mornin’, do ye?” he questioned, leaning over and peering into the face
of the Overland girl.</p>

<p>“No, sir. No one has passed here, so far as I know, since daylight. I
don’t know who passed before that. Why do you ask?”</p>

<p>“We’re a posse on the track of a hoss thief. The bay mare he rode was
stole, and some gold he had was stole, too.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” observed Elfreda.</p>

<p>“We trailed the thief this way, but back a piece we kind of lost the
trail,” volunteered the Hawk, grinning apologetically. “Be ye alone?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. I am with a party. They are not here now, but I look for them
to arrive shortly,” she answered, trying hard not to appear disturbed.</p>

<p>“Well, so long. We’ll be on our way.” The man swung off his hat and,
wheeling his horse about, jogged along. Her heart sank as she saw that
the riders were taking a direction, which, if followed on, would lead
perilously close to the spot at which she had secreted Sam Petersen’s
horse. She regarded each man keenly as they passed her, and theirs she
saw on close inspection were hard, callous, reckless faces. There was
coldness, there was daring, in them.</p>

<p>The last man in the line, younger than his companions, while his face
was also cold, appeared to be of a character different from the others.
There was a poise of the head, a grace in riding, and in the manner with
which he bowed as he swung his hat low, that singled him out as a man
somewhat above his fellows, in intelligence at least.</p>

<p>The riders were out of sight in a moment, and, with their passing,
Elfreda Briggs’ knees grew suddenly weak. She staggered into the cabin
and sat down heavily.</p>

<p>“Had they come in I don’t know what I should have done,” murmured the
girl, placing a hand on the diary that she had hidden in her blouse. The
bag of nuggets and “dust” lay in plain sight near the bunk on which Sam
Petersen lay. Elfreda hurriedly sprang up and secreted the bag under the
blankets. Then a sudden thought came to her. She recalled that the old
prospector wore a holster, and that she had noticed the size of the
revolver butt that protruded from it. Instant determination to possess
herself of the weapon seized her.</p>

<p>“They will return! I feel it!” she cried.</p>

<p>It took but a moment to get the weapon and the cartridge belt, to both
of which the girl gave critical inspection, for Elfreda had handled
revolvers, both in France in wartime, and on their annual summer outings
in the saddle. The weapon was loaded, and several rounds of cartridges
still remained in the belt.</p>

<p>“There!” she exclaimed, after strapping the holster on. “I at least have
the means of defending myself. Hark!”</p>

<p>Hoof-beats were plainly audible, but they seemed to be those of only one
horse. A glance through the doorway, without revealing herself, verified
this.</p>

<p>“It’s the good-looking one,” breathed Elfreda, retiring into the shadows
and giving her holster a shift. “I must go out. It never will do to let
that man come into the cabin,” she decided as she stepped to the door
with an expression of surprised inquiry in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Ye didn’t think I’d be back so soon, did ye?” he grinned.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I looked for you to return,” Elfreda replied. “What is it
you wish?”</p>

<p>“I reckoned as I’d like a drink of water.”</p>

<p>“Wait. I will fetch a dipper. The spring is just beyond the stump over
yonder.” Elfreda was out with a dipper in her hand in a moment, and held
it up to him, but the rider did not take it. He swung from the saddle
and stood leaning against his mount, regarding her with something like a
twinkle in his eyes. Elfreda saw that twinkle and was reassured.</p>

<p>“I see ye’ve got your hardware on,” he said, pointing to the revolver.
“Purty sizable gun for a lady, eh? Ye didn’t have it on when I was here
before.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I was expecting more company after you went off. Why do you
ask?”</p>

<p>The rider shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Reckon I’ll take that dipper now,” he said, extending a hand for it.
Elfreda gave it to him, and keen as his eyes were, it is doubtful if he
discovered the fear that Elfreda felt. After stepping back she got a
broom and began sweeping up the cabin floor, which she was still doing
when the man returned from the spring. Hearing him coming, she stepped
outside.</p>

<p>“Thankee,” he said, returning the dipper.</p>

<p>“What would ye say, lady, if I told ye I wanted to search the shack?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“I should say <i>no!</i>” was the emphatic reply.</p>

<p>“And what if I decided to do it anyhow?” grinned the mountain rider.</p>

<p>“I’d shoot you!” she answered coldly.</p>

<p>“Sufferin’ cats! I believe ye would. Never can tell what these quiet
kind might do. Can I have a look at the little toy?” he teased.</p>

<p>“You may look at the muzzle, if you wish.”</p>

<p>The fellow laughed and slapped his thigh.</p>

<p>“Ye’re a cool one, I’ll tell them all.”</p>

<p>“Thank you.” Elfreda was covertly watching every movement of her caller,
every expression of face and eyes, and she could not but feel that he
was unusually confident about something. Rack her brain as she might,
she could not think what that something might be, unless Hawk’s party
had discovered the bay mare, which she did not believe was a fact, for
the party had swerved off to the right after leaving the vicinity of the
forest cabin.</p>

<p>“If I reckerlect, lady, ye told the boss that ye hadn’t seen any
strangers hereabouts—a fellow on a bay mare, an old party and a tough
one.”</p>

<p>“I told you no one had passed here, and to the latter part of your
question I am free to say that your party included the only ‘tough ones’
I have seen since coming into the forest.”</p>

<p>“So! I reckon I see the p’int. Lady, what about that saddle over there
in the brush?”</p>

<p>Elfreda could feel her face going pale.</p>

<p>“The—the saddle!” she gasped, but instantly recovered herself. “What
saddle do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I mean Sam Petersen’s saddle. I’d know that leather among all the rest
in the Cascade range. He stole that, too. Now where’s the bay mare? He
sure didn’t ride her away without the saddle.”</p>

<p>“Find him, if you want to know. Don’t ask me! As for the saddle that you
say is over yonder in the brush, draw whatever conclusions you wish. Is
that all? If so, I have work to do and will go to it,” announced J.
Elfreda with great dignity.</p>

<p>“I reckon that’s ’bout all, ’cept that I’d like to look over that
shack.”</p>

<p>“Very well, you may step up to the door and look in, but no farther if
you value your life,” replied Elfreda, turning her back on him and
stepping through the doorway.</p>

<p>The visitor was not slow to accept the invitation. He reached the
threshold, and was about to stride into the cabin when he suddenly found
himself facing the old prospector’s revolver, held in the steady hand of
Elfreda Briggs.</p>

<p>“You may take a look at the revolver now if you like,” she offered.
“Stay where you are!”</p>

<p>A glint came into the man’s eyes, a glint of danger, but it faded and he
laughed.</p>

<p>“Very neat, Miss. I think I’ll take a look at that bunk over there, and
that there hole in the floor with the trap door in it.”</p>

<p>“Out! Instantly!” Elfreda’s voice rang out with a new note in it.</p>

<p>The unwelcome guest’s hand sagged slowly towards his own holster.</p>

<p>“Hands up! Quick!”</p>

<p>The man obeyed, his eyes never leaving hers, nor did Elfreda’s eyes
leave those of her caller. While he undoubtedly, with his long
experience in quick work, could have dodged and drawn and fired ere Miss
Briggs was able to prevent it, he did not do so. Perhaps he feared that
she might hit his horse instead of himself, for that animal was directly
in range with her weapon.</p>

<p>“Mount! Leave this place instantly! If you attempt to interfere with me
you will do so at your peril!” she warned.</p>

<p>“Farewell, lady,” he answered mockingly. “I shall see ye just the same,
and ye will answer my questions next time.” The fellow swung into his
saddle, Miss Briggs still keeping her weapon trained on him as she
followed him out.</p>

<p>Then she saw the man suddenly stiffen in his saddle, and what followed
came at such speed that she was dazed. The fellow’s revolver leaped, it
seemed to her, from its holster and met his hand half way. There was a
sudden report, and a faint puff of grayish smoke from the muzzle.</p>

<p>A fraction of a second, after the report of his weapon, brought a shot
from somewhere to the left of the Overland girl. The bandit’s horse
jumped, and to Elfreda it was plain that the animal had been hit. It
reared, and its rider toppled over and plunged backwards to the ground.</p>

<p class='caption'>The Bandit Was Using Elfreda as a Shield.</p>
</div>

<p>“He’s killed!” cried Miss Briggs, dropping her own weapon and running to
the prostrate bandit who lay where he had fallen, his face turned to one
side, and half hidden by his sombrero. She gave no thought to the peril
that she might be inviting by aiding the ruffian. Her one thought was to
give aid.</p>

<p>The girl was bending over him, when, in a flash, the fellow was on his
feet, and two sinewy hands had grabbed her arms and whirled her about in
the direction of the shot that had been fired at him. Elfreda Briggs had
walked into a trap!</p>

<p>That was not all. A report at her ear was followed by another and
another. The bandit was shooting over her shoulder, using the Overland
girl as a shield.</p>

<p>There were no answering shots, nor could Elfreda see what the bandit had
been shooting at, but she stood frozen, while he, alert and cool, kept
his gaze fixed on a clump of bushes a few dozen yards ahead of them.</p>

<p>Elfreda had not uttered a sound. She was trembling, but rather than have
the man using her as a shield know this she summoned all her will power
and gained control of herself.</p>

<p>The bandit fired again. The shooting, so close to her ear, fairly
deafened her. Elfreda had another cause for worry, for she did not know
at what instant the bandit’s enemy might conclude to fire again. To a
person in her position, that was not a comforting thought. No answering
shot came, and the girl drew a long breath of relief.</p>

<p>Not a word had passed between them up to this point, but now she spoke.</p>

<p>“You coward!” breathed Elfreda.</p>

<p>“Had to do it,” was the brief reply.</p>

<p>“You will pay dearly for this,” she threatened.</p>

<p>“Shut up! I’ll give ye a clout over the head if ye don’t, and I’d hate
to do that to a purty gal like—” <i>Bang!</i></p>

<p>The bandit fired. Then a strange thing happened, and Elfreda was hurled
forward on her face with unexpected violence.</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER VIII</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>STACY TAKES A HAND</span>
</h2>

<p>“Wow! I’ll show you that you can’t steal my beans and my fish!” yelled
an angry voice behind Miss Briggs. The outlaw was pulling himself
together and unsteadily getting to his feet just as Elfreda sprang to
hers. Then there sounded a sudden whack, a grunt, and the bandit again
measured his length on the ground, after receiving another blow on the
head.</p>

<p>“Stacy! Stacy Brown!” cried Elfreda, for it was Stacy who had stolen up
behind the bandit and clouted the outlaw on the head with a stick just
after the fellow had fired his last shot.</p>

<p>Ere the man had fully recovered from this last whack, Chunky had sprung
forward and snatched up the bandit’s weapon.</p>

<p>“Now you get out of this before I get mad. I’m only out of patience now,
but when I’m mad I’m a dangerous man. Get!”</p>

<p>With his own revolver trained on him, the bandit evidently considered
prudence the wise course. He had not yet fully recovered from Stacy’s
last wallop, and staggered as he ran to his horse. As he swung into his
saddle, a shot from somewhere brought a grunt from the fellow, and the
Overlander saw the bandit shudder.</p>

<p>“Don’t shoot! He’s hit,” warned Elfreda.</p>

<p>“I didn’t shoot this time. It was someone else,” flung back the boy.
“You move, and you move fast. And next time you steal a fellow’s beans
and fish, you pick out some fellow who’ll stand for it!”</p>

<p>The outlaw rode away at a brisk gallop, swaying a little in his saddle,
still considerably dazed from Stacy’s two wallops, and in pain from the
bullet that had hit him.</p>

<p>“Stacy! Oh, Stacy!” cried Elfreda, running to the boy and throwing both
arms about him. “You wonderful boy! I never thought you had such
courage.”</p>

<p>“Courage? I’m a hero! I always was. All I needed was the opportunity to
show that I am. I ought to have a medal.”</p>

<p>“You shall have one. Do—do you think he will come back?” she asked with
an apprehensive glance in the direction taken by the outlaw.</p>

<p>“Come back? Why, I should say he wouldn’t. That fellow is scared stiff.
You couldn’t drag him back here.”</p>

<p>“There are others, Stacy. You don’t know all. They were all here, and
after they went away he came back and—”</p>

<p>“Others?” Stacy’s face went solemn. “If that’s the case, I reckon we’d
better run while the running is good.”</p>

<p>“I can’t, not yet. I must talk with you. There is something to be done
before we leave. But you were so brave, and all the time you were hiding
behind the bushes, letting that desperate fellow shoot at you without
your firing a shot fearing that you might hit me. It was wonderful! What
did you mean when you accused the man of stealing your fish—had you seen
him before?”</p>

<p>“Of course I had seen him. He tried to interfere with me while I was
fishing for a mess of trout for you yesterday afternoon. I did get a
mess of them, beauties, too,” declared Stacy boastfully. “I finally got
tired; the bait gave out, so I ate part of a can of beans and lay down
for a nap. Well, I didn’t wake up, I guess, until this morning. The fish
were gone, and so were the rest of the beans. I tell you I was good and
angry. When I got here you were having your misunderstanding with the
ruffian.”</p>

<p>“And you really were in those bushes shooting at him?”</p>

<p>“I was in the bushes all right.”</p>

<p>“But who fired that last shot that hit him?” demanded Miss Briggs
suddenly, regarding her companion narrowly.</p>

<p>“The—the sec—That’s so. I wonder who did. He was some shooter. But
listen! I know. It must have been one of that fiend’s friends shooting
at me. He didn’t hit the fellow he fired at. Isn’t that a good joke on
the fellow in the bushes, and on the one that got hit!” cried the fat
boy, his assurance returning. “Tell me what has happened here.” Stacy
was stalking back and forth twirling the outlaw’s weapon on his finger.</p>

<p>“Come with me to the shack and I will tell you. Tragedy, not comedy, has
come to this place. I would have given anything could you have been here
to help me, for, Stacy, I needed help as I never in my life needed it
before. Listen, for we must lose no time in doing what we have to do,
and then get away from this unhappy spot.”</p>

<p>They were in the cabin by this time.</p>

<p>“A man came here last night, wounded and faint. I tried to help him, but
he was beyond help. Stacy, the poor fellow died. Those ruffians had shot
him. I do not think the man who shot him was the one who made a shield
of me, but it was one of the same gang.”</p>

<p>“Di—died!” gasped Stacy.</p>

<p>“Yes, in a few minutes after he got here. I have his horse hidden some
little distance from here.”</p>

<p>“Whe—whe—where is he?”</p>

<p>“There!” she announced gently, pointing to the bunk. “We can’t leave him
there, Stacy. There is something to be done, and I just can’t bring
myself to do it.”</p>

<p>Stacy, his eyes large and round, backed hurriedly from the shack.</p>

<p>“Come on out. I can’t talk in there any more,” he urged, and Elfreda
joined him at once. “Let me think. I can’t do it, either. I can fight a
bad man, or wild animals, but this—this I—I can’t. Why did they shoot
him?”</p>

<p>“They said he was a horse thief, but I know better. He possessed
information that they wanted. This fellow that you sent away found the
man’s saddle, though I don’t know how he chanced to discover it. The
horse he may have discovered also, but I hardly think so. If not, we can
take the animal and try to find our way back to Silver Creek.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Let’s find the horse. We can send Ham White back to do what you
said. Where is the horse?”</p>

<p>“We will go look for him, but we must proceed with caution,” said
Elfreda. “Take your revolver and I will take mine. You fall in behind. I
will lead because I know the way.”</p>

<p>Stacy did not appear to relish the mission at all, but he relished still
less being left alone at the cabin, so he followed along obediently.
Elfreda proceeded with great caution, watching the ground and the
surrounding forest.</p>

<p>“Keep perfectly quiet,” she warned, as they neared the spot where the
horse had been secreted. “Stay where you are,” added Elfreda in a
whisper, then crept forward.</p>

<p>“This is spooky,” muttered the fat boy. “I don’t like what I can’t see.”</p>

<p>“Stacy!” There was alarm in Elfreda’s voice. “Come here!”</p>

<p>He did not move as rapidly as he might, but a few moments later was
standing at her side, and Stacy blinked as his gaze followed the
direction in which she pointed.</p>

<p>A handsome bay mare lay dead in the secluded spot. It was the horse that
Sam Petersen had left in her charge.</p>

<p>“Shot! The brutes!” cried Elfreda. “They have shot her. Well, perhaps
that is better. Mr. Petersen asked me to dispose of the animal or hide
her. What a pity!”</p>

<p>“I call it a good riddance. Say, Elfreda, you don’t suppose any of that
gang are hanging around here, do you?” questioned Stacy apprehensively.</p>

<p>“Gracious! I hope not. Come, let us get away from this place.”</p>

<p>Stacy was quite ready to move, and took the lead, Elfreda following.
They lost no time in getting back to the cabin, but, as they approached,
Stacy again began to lag.</p>

<p>“Aren’t we going down to the river and try to find our way back to our
party?” he asked as his companion started to enter the cottage.</p>

<p>“Not yet. I have something to do in here first,” she made reply. “Oh!”
Elfreda sprang back.</p>

<p>“Wha—wha—what!”</p>

<p>“There’s someone in there,” she whispered.</p>

<p>“Oh, wow!” Stacy jumped and started off.</p>

<p>Elfreda looked her disgust, and, summoning her courage, stepped into the
cabin.</p>

<p>“Who is it?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“I was waiting to see how steady your nerves are,” answered a voice that
brought a thrill to her. A man rose and stepped towards her.</p>

<p>“Mr. White! Stacy, come in, it’s all right,” she called, a happier note
in her voice. “I am so glad to see you, for I need you.” Elfreda shook
hands with the guide. “How long have you been here?”</p>

<p>“I came in just a moment ago. My horse is down near the river, where I
picked up your trail and came up here. What has been going on here? I
believe there was some shooting up this way. So it sounded to me.”</p>

<p>“The Murrays have been here, and, had it not been for Stacy, I fear
something serious might have happened to me. Stacy really saved me, even
going so far as to let one of the outlaws shoot at him. Would you think,
from what you have seen of him, that Stacy is brave enough to fight a
duel with one of that gang?”</p>

<p>Ham White looked solemn and shook his head.</p>

<p>“Our party is very much worried about you, Miss Briggs—”</p>

<p>“Oh, are they all right?” cried the Overland girl, flushing at thought
of her forgetfulness.</p>

<p>“Every one of them, but we must get back to them as soon as possible.
Tell me the story.”</p>

<p>Elfreda then related the whole story of her experiences, passing briefly
over her trip down the creek and the river, and relating the story of
the arrival of Sam Petersen and his death, omitting the incident of the
diary, as well as the story of the lost mine and the bag of nuggets and
dust.</p>

<p>“Died here? Where is—”</p>

<p>“There!” answered the girl in a low voice, pointing to the bunk. “You
and Stacy will please do what is necessary. I could do it if I had to,
but so long as you are here it is better not.”</p>

<p>“What did the ruffian who came back here look like?”</p>

<p>Miss Briggs described the man in detail.</p>

<p>“That was Two-gun Murray, one of the most notorious gun-fighters on the
range. He has more brains than his brother, Hawk Murray, and some
personal charm, but he is a cold-blooded ruffian. Is he the fellow you
saw down by the river, that Miss Briggs has told me about?” questioned
White, turning to Stacy.</p>

<p>“Yes. And he is the fellow who stole my fish and ate my beans,”
complained the boy.</p>

<p>“I wonder what that crowd was after Sam Petersen for?” reflected the
guide, regarding the two Overlanders from beneath half-closed eyelids.</p>

<p>“He had something that they wanted—information or something of the
sort,” murmured Miss Briggs. Elfreda was not yet ready to confide in the
guide. She wished for time to think over carefully what Petersen had
told her, and to examine his diary critically.</p>

<p>“I don’t quite get it, but I will,” he replied.</p>

<p>Ham White got up briskly.</p>

<p>“Come, Stacy. Let us do our duty.”</p>

<p>“Just a moment,” begged Elfreda. “I wish to do something here first.
Will you two please step outside?”</p>

<p>The guide gave her a quick look, and his face hardened ever so little.
He bowed and walked from the cabin. The instant he was out of sight,
Miss Briggs got the bag of gold and secreted it in her blouse.</p>

<p>“Mr. White, I am going out in the forest to think, while you are busy
here,” she added, stepping from the cabin. Elfreda’s face was flushed.
Hamilton White regarded her narrowly but merely nodded in reply to her
announcement. That nod was cold, and Miss Briggs realized it. Her head
was held a little higher as she walked away, though she knew that
self-imagined guilt was at the back of her annoyance.</p>

<p>Ham White knew that there was some purpose in the Overland girl’s
remaining in the cabin for a few moments; perhaps he came nearer to
knowing her purpose than Elfreda imagined.</p>

<p>The girl sat down under a tree and thought. The bag of gold in her
blouse troubled her. Elfreda took it out and emptied the contents in her
lap. Apparently a small fortune lay there, but, as she gathered up a
handful of the contents of the bag, Elfreda Briggs made a terrible
discovery.</p>

</h2>

<p>“Miss Briggs, do you feel equal to starting back to Silver Creek?”
questioned the guide as she returned. “The sooner we get away from here
the better it may be for us.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Anything to get away from this haunt of tragedy. How far are we
from there?”</p>

<p>“About thirty-five kilometers, I should say, though it may be more.”</p>

<p>Elfreda glanced at him quickly.</p>

<p>“Were you in service in France during the war?” she questioned.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“May I ask in what capacity? You know the girls of this party were there
with the Overton College unit.”</p>

<p>“I was with the signal corps. To return to the subject of our journey, I
have a horse a short distance from here. You may ride him, and Mr. Brown
and I will walk.”</p>

<p>“Walk! Walk thirty-five miles?” demanded Stacy in a tone that was almost
a wail.</p>

<p>“I said thirty-five kilometers, not thirty-five miles,” corrected the
guide.</p>

<p>“I don’t care which it is; thirty-five of anything is too far for me. I
can’t walk. I have a sore finger. I stuck it on a fishhook yesterday,”
protested the fat boy.</p>

<p>“Very well, you may remain here if you wish. Come, Miss Briggs. We must
take along some of the provisions that are in the cabin.”</p>

<p>“Mr. White found those too,” thought Elfreda, then aloud: “Have we the
right to do that?”</p>

<p>“Within reason, yes. This is a forest ranger’s cabin, and one is free to
help himself.” Stacy ran in and filled his pockets with cans, and the
guide took a can of beans for himself and one for Miss Briggs, directing
Stacy to put back all but one of those he had taken. The three then set
out at a brisk walk, and at about a mile from the cabin they turned off,
and soon found the horse, on which they placed the Overland girl. After
mounting, she secretly tucked the canvas bag into the saddle pocket.</p>

<p>It was a relief to Elfreda not to have to walk, and further, it gave her
opportunity to study the wiry figure of Hamilton White as he strode
along in the rear of Stacy, whom he was urging along, much to that young
man’s freely voiced disgust.</p>

<p>Shortly after noon they stopped to water the horse and to give the rider
an opportunity to rest. They then pressed on, for the way was rough and
progress slow. It was near night when they came within hailing distance
of Silver Creek village, and a great shout went up from the Overlanders
when they saw Elfreda.</p>

<p>During the absence of the guide, the Overlanders’ missing horse had come
in, enabling the Overland Riders to resume their journey to the Cascade
Range. It was an evening of rejoicing for them, in which the villagers
joined, for the young women of the Overland party had been of great
assistance to them in their trouble. Not alone that, but it was freely
admitted that Ham White and the Overlanders had saved the village from
destruction.</p>

<p>Early on the following morning, after bidding good-bye to the villagers,
the Overlanders rode away. On the way, Miss Briggs told her companions
of her experiences during her absence, omitting any reference to the bag
of gold and the diary. Even Hamilton White had no idea that she
possessed it, so far as she was aware, though Elfreda was not so certain
that he did not suspect her having the bag of gold.</p>

<p>It was noticed by at least one of the party that Miss Briggs and the
guide had little to say to each other that day; in fact, they seemed to
avoid each other. Not so with Emma Dean, who kept as close to Hamilton
White as she could, hanging on his words and showing her keen interest
in him in the expression of her eyes. At supper that evening, however,
Elfreda asked him a direct question.</p>

<p>“Mr. White, have you ever heard of a stream known as Lost River?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“I have,” spoke up Stacy Brown. “I fell in it the other night when they
had the fireworks at Silver Creek village.”</p>

<p>“I believe there is an old Indian legend of some sort about Lost
River—something to do with gold or silver,” replied the guide, giving
her a swift, appraising glance.</p>

<p>“Is there such a thing as an Indian legend about ‘Grandma and the
Children’?” persisted Elfreda.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha! That’s a good one. Did they fall into the foaming flood also?”
demanded Chunky in a loud voice.</p>

<p>“Children should be seen and not heard,” rebuked Emma sternly.</p>

<p>“Is that why you are so quiet to-day, Miss Dean?” asked the boy.</p>

<p>“I am quiet, Stacy Brown, because you so disturb the atmosphere that one
has to shout to make herself heard at all,” returned Emma with great
dignity.</p>

<p>The Overlanders laughed heartily.</p>

<p>“I reckon that will hold you for a few moments,” interjected Hippy
Wingate. “Got anything more to say on the subject, young man?”</p>

<p>“Not a word.”</p>

<p>Stacy did not even join in the laugh that followed.</p>

<p>By this time they had finished their supper, and Elfreda nodded to Grace
to indicate that she wished to speak with her, and the two strolled off
without attracting attention. They were soon out of earshot, and Grace
suggested that they go no farther.</p>

<p>“Now what is it that is troubling you, J. Elfreda?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I have a guilty conscience, dear Loyalheart, and I must confess to
you.”</p>

<p>“I knew you had something on your mind,” nodded Grace. “So far as
concerns your having a guilty conscience, that is impossible. You only
imagine it.”</p>

<p>“After you have heard my story you will think differently. Grace, you
don’t know all that took place in the forest cabin—all that occurred in
connection with the death of the old prospector.” Elfreda then related
the story in detail, giving the real reason, as told to her by Petersen,
for the attack of the Murrays. “Have you your lamp, your pocket lamp?”</p>

<p>Grace produced her flashlight, and Miss Briggs, taking it from her,
turned a bar of light on the diary that she had removed from her blouse.</p>

<p>“This is it, Grace, and here are the notes I made of what Mr. Petersen
told me. I haven’t read the writing in Mr. Petersen’s diary—I haven’t
had the heart or the inclination to do so. I feel like a thief.”</p>

<p>“Elfreda!” rebuked Grace.</p>

<p>“Then you think I have a right to keep this—this thing?”</p>

<p>“Why not? You say he has no family, no relatives. What you have shown me
is, in reality, the will of a dying man. He gave you what he had in
payment for your kindness to him. So far as his story of finding the
lost mine is concerned, I am inclined to think it a myth. At any rate,
don’t trouble your head over the matter any more. The chances are that,
even if the mine really exists, we never shall find it, but when Tom
joins us in the Cascades I will lay the facts before him. Tom knows this
country pretty well. That is why the Government is employing him to make
a timber survey, and at the same time, to look into some other matters.”</p>

<p>“But, Grace, this is going to be a terrible weight on my mind,”
protested Elfreda.</p>

<p>“And you a successful lawyer!” laughed Grace. “I never thought that a
lawyer could be so conscientious. And think of the romance of all this,”
went on Grace Harlowe with growing enthusiasm. “Have you no romance in
your soul?”</p>

<p>Miss Briggs shook her head.</p>

<p>“It is not given to many girls to play a leading part in a search for a
lost gold mine. Even the suggestion of courting peril ought to appeal to
you, Elfreda. I should like to go through the diary with care. I don’t
like doing that now when we can’t see about us, as we have reason to
believe that there may be people in this vicinity who would stop at
nothing to obtain possession of it. Of course, we are safe here, though.
What about the bag of nuggets and dust that Petersen gave you?”</p>

<p>“I have the bag. The contents I threw away.”</p>

<p>“Elfreda Briggs!” cried Grace indignantly. “Threw away a bag of gold
nuggets and gold dust! Are you crazy?”</p>

<p>“I may be, Grace dear. When I opened the bag, after putting Mr.
Petersen’s horse away, I found that it contained nothing but worthless
quartz rock. There was no gold there. The nuggets and gold dust had been
taken out. Someone had stolen the nuggets and dust in the short time
that I was away from the shack.”</p>

<p>Grace uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>“When Stacy and I returned to the shack, we found Mr. White sitting in
the cabin. I asked him to go outside for a moment, and while he was away
I got the bag. Then I made an excuse for going out into the forest. On
emptying the contents of the bag into my lap I found that I was the
proud possessor of only a bag of worthless stones!”</p>

<p>“Elfreda! You don’t mean to infer that Mr. White took it—you can’t think
such a terrible thing of him!” begged Grace.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what to think. He was there; he has acted peculiarly ever
since, and has avoided me. Isn’t it a natural thing for me at least to
wonder?” demanded Miss Briggs.</p>

<p>“Elfreda Briggs, I am amazed!” cried Grace Harlowe. “Is that why you
have been so cold and distant towards the guide? He does not deserve
such treatment. Were I in your place I should, in the light of what you
have told me, tell him the story that you have related to me.”</p>

<p>“No, no!” Elfreda said with strong emphasis. “I have no reason for
confiding in anyone but you. Neither shall I do anything farther in this
matter. Gold mines—gold doesn’t bring happiness. Quite the contrary, so
far as my experience goes.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is true, but after one has found happiness, gold is a mighty
good thing to keep that happiness from getting wobbly. I—” Grace paused
abruptly. She thought she had heard a sound close at hand. Grabbing the
flashlight, she swung the bar of light about with one hand, the other
hand holding the prospector’s diary.</p>

<p>An amazing thing occurred.</p>

<p>The prospector’s diary was whisked away from Grace Harlowe, leaving in
her hand only a leaf out of it that she had held between her fingers.</p>

<p>“Overland!” It was the shrill rallying cry of the Overland Riders, and
hearing it, they sprang to their feet and ran up, as Grace Harlowe’s cry
for assistance was echoing through the forest.</p>

<p>Ham White reached the two girls first, calling out his name as he
charged to them.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Someone was here, Mr. White. At least someone or something snatched a
book out of my hands. I saw no one, but am positive that I heard someone
just before the occurrence,” Grace informed him.</p>

<p>The rest of the party, with the exception of Stacy Brown, were on the
scene a moment or so later, each with an eager question.</p>

<p>“Why, Hamilton, you went out that way a few moments before the girls
were disturbed. Didn’t you see anyone?” wondered Emma.</p>

<p>The guide shook his head. He was regarding Grace and Elfreda with a
curious expression on his face as they came within range of the
campfire.</p>

<p>“Was the book of value?” he asked, meeting Miss Briggs’ eyes. She
returned his gaze with a level glance.</p>

<p>“It may have been, Mr. White,” replied the girl, turning away.</p>

<p>Grace laughed. The incident had not disturbed her, but the mystery of it
did. That a prowler could get so close to her without attracting her
attention hurt her pride. Her companions were much more upset than was
either of the two active participants. Stacy slept through it all, and
did not awaken until morning.</p>

<p>It was some time after that before the camp settled down for the night,
but the guide sat in the shadows, smoking his pipe and thinking.</p>

<p>“Did you hear what Emma said?” questioned Elfreda in a whisper to Grace
as they snuggled under their blankets.</p>

<p>“About what?”</p>

<p>“About Mr. White. It seems he may have been somewhere near us out
there.”</p>

<p>“This affair has several queer phases,” admitted Grace.</p>

<p>“I don’t care. I’m glad the diary is out of my hands; now I can wash
them of it all, and my conscience at the same time. My gold mine has
gone a-glimmering.” Elfreda laughed, but without much mirth.</p>

<p>“My dear J. Elfreda, you are not going to get off so easily. Here is the
page on which you wrote the location of the gold mine at Mr. Petersen’s
direction. I had the leaf in my hand when the book was snatched away,
and it just tore itself loose and remained with me. So you see you are
still fated to be a millionaire. Reason will tell you that the book may
not be of value to the possessor.”</p>

<p>Miss Briggs asked why.</p>

<p>“Because,” replied Grace, “there can be nothing very definite in the
diary or it would not have been necessary for Mr. Petersen to give you
the definite directions that he did. The matter of real value, you will
find, is on the sheet that I still have. I’ll give it to you in the
morning. My advice to you is to commit those lines to memory, and then
burn the slip of paper.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I will burn it all right,” agreed Miss Briggs. “Don’t say gold to
me again to-night. I wish to sleep—to sleep peacefully.” Elfreda made
good her word on the following morning, and destroyed the slip of paper.</p>

<p>Before the others were awake the guide went out and was away from the
camp for more than an hour. He was just returning when Hippy Wingate
came out.</p>

<p>“Find anything exciting this morning?” asked Hippy jovially.</p>

<p>“Yes. Someone was prowling about the camp last night. I found the spot
where the young ladies were sitting, and I also found the imprints of
booted feet. About a quarter of a mile to the west of us a horse was
tethered, and the fellow who was here undoubtedly rode it, and went
north, after leaving this vicinity. Is it your wish that I run his trail
out, Lieutenant?”</p>

<p>“No. What’s the use? If he is particularly interested in us he will come
again, and maybe he will come once too often and get caught,” suggested
Hippy.</p>

<p>The guide bowed and went about getting breakfast. The party was in their
saddles at an early hour, turning their faces toward the north, and the
Cascade Range, which was their destination. It was a glorious day, and
even Hamilton White thawed under the sweet lure of the forest, and
talked forest and woodcraft to his party.</p>

<p>They camped that night in a rocky pass, well sheltered, and with a
mountain stream at their feet. Everyone was tired, and chilled from the
mist that was settling over the pass. Before anything else was done, a
fire was built and coffee prepared by the girls. Then Ham White began
making camp, and Stacy and Lieutenant Wingate cared for the horses.</p>

<p>Stacy, very proud of his saddle, which he had ridden for a long time, in
fact ever since he had ridden with the Pony Rider Boys on their many
adventurous journeys, brought the saddle in and threw it down near the
fire. Something fell out of the saddle pocket. Stacy picked it up and
looked at the object frowningly.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” demanded Grace a little sharply.</p>

<p>“That? I’m blest if I know,” answered Stacy, his face showing some
perplexity.</p>

<p>Grace took the object from him, glanced into it, and looking up at
Elfreda, laughed.</p>

<p>“Here is the book—the diary,” announced Grace, extending it to Miss
Briggs. “Remember what I told you last night? Did I not say that you
would not get off so easily? Stacy, how did you come by this?” demanded
the Overland girl, turning to the fat boy.</p>

<p>“What’s all the fuss about? I picked it up when I went after my horse
this morning and forgot all about it. Why the excitement?”</p>

<p>“There is no excitement,” answered Miss Briggs with dignity as she
tucked the old prospector’s diary into her blouse. “Mr. White, Mr. Brown
found the missing book and has returned it to us.”</p>

<p>Before anyone could comment on the find or ask questions about it, Ham
White held up a hand for silence.</p>

<p>From far away came a shot. After a little it was followed by two shots,
an interval and one shot.</p>

<p>“A signal,” announced the guide.</p>

<p>Hippy Wingate raised his revolver to fire.</p>

<p>“Stop!” commanded Ham White. “Let the other fellow do the shooting. We
aren’t certain that we want to know him.” There was meaning in the
guide’s words, a warning, and the Overlanders fell silent. There was
also the vivid memory with Elfreda and Grace of the mysterious hand that
had snatched the prospector’s diary, and both girls felt an intuition of
other mysteries to come.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='chX' title='X: The Man From Seattle'>
  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER X</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>THE MAN FROM SEATTLE</span>
</h2>

<p>“Someone is coming,” announced Grace, when, half an hour later, her keen
ears detected a sound, faint, though unmistakable. She was the only one
of the party to hear it at that instant, though a moment later the guide
nodded.</p>

<p>The Overlanders saw him hitch his revolver holster into convenient
position as he stood up and leaned easily against a tree.</p>

<p>“As I was saying,” he began. “Sometimes it rains and sometimes it snows,
and—”</p>

<p>“Hands up!” rang out a sudden command. “Put ’em up till I look you
over.”</p>

<p>Stacy Brown was the only one of the party that obeyed the command. The
Overlanders were too much interested in the newcomer to obey the
command, for he was fantastically clad. The fellow was holding two
revolvers which he kept moving from side to side, his keen eyes
regarding the party appraisingly as well as alertly. It was his clothing
that attracted most attention, for the man was dressed like a Mexican
rancher, with the velvet jacket, embroidered with silver, the broad
sombrero, likewise embellished with silver, and the faint metallic
tinkle of silver spurs was heard as he shifted his position.</p>

<p>The keen expression in his eyes changed to a twinkle.</p>

<p>“Well, well, who would have thought it!” he exclaimed. “A bunch of
foozleheads.”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha, ha!” laughed Stacy Brown. “Foozleheads! That is a brand new
one. Emma, he is looking at you.”</p>

<p>The newcomer lowered his weapons and shoved them into their holsters.</p>

<p>“Well, who are you?” demanded Ham White. “You appear to be a new
specimen up here.”</p>

<p>“Who, me? Haven’t you heard of me? I’m Jim Haley, sole representative of
the International Peanut Company in the State of Washington. I’m known
as the Man from Seattle, and I’ll have peanuts in every home, in every
bandit cave in the great preserves of the State, and all over the rugged
peaks of the Cascades if I hold out long enough. Peanuts are a great
civilizer; they are the oil on troubled waters, and if the wild men up
here were to eat enough of them I’ll guarantee that they never would
hold up another unfortunate traveler.”</p>

<p>“Bandits?” questioned the guide, regarding the visitor narrowly.</p>

<p>“Yes. They’ve held me up twice in twenty-four hours, and the last time
they took my horse away.”</p>

<p>“It strikes me that you are quite handy with hold-up methods yourself,”
observed Hippy Wingate.</p>

<p>“Peanuts? Peanuts?” demanded Stacy eagerly. “Got any with you?”</p>

<p>“It will be my everlasting regret that I have not. You see I ate up most
of my samples, then the bandits took the rest of them. This is a rotten
country. I had to get food, and when I smelled your smoke I took a
chance, not knowing whether or not I was running into another bunch of
bandits, and here I am, safe and sound. Luck is with the Man from
Seattle, the greatest peanut salesman in the world. I’ll have a cup of
coffee, if you please, and anything else that’s lying around loose, then
I shall be delighted to take your orders for peanuts to be delivered at
your homes, freight paid, and an extra bag gratis for good luck.”</p>

<p>“Why, certainly, you shall have something to eat,” promised Grace.
“Girls, help me rustle some grub for our caller. Were you lost?”</p>

<p>“Lost? Why, I’ve never found myself since I came into the forest. How
could a man, who never has known where he was at, be lost? Been held up
by these mountain ruffians yet?”</p>

<p>The Overlanders shook their heads.</p>

<p>“They are so sudden. Why, they wouldn’t even give me an opportunity to
demonstrate—”</p>

<p>“Demonstrate!” cried Emma with sudden interest. “Do you demonstrate, Mr.
Hart—”</p>

<p>“Haley, if you please,” interjected the newcomer.</p>

<p>“Really, do you, Mr. Haley?”</p>

<p>“Of course I do.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that perfectly lovely! You see, girls, I am not the only one that
demonstrates to ward off trouble. Just think, think hard, that something
you desire very much, will be, and it will be.”</p>

<p>The Man from Seattle looked puzzled for a moment, then he laughed
heartily.</p>

<p>“Demonstrate a bag of peanuts for me, then,” spoke up Stacy Brown.</p>

<p>“That’s it, young man—it’s peanuts that I demonstrate. I’ll see that you
get a fair sample when I get back to Seattle,” promised Haley.</p>

<p>“Oh, fudge! Everything is food with you, Stacy Brown. Why can’t you be
less gross, and more spiritual?” complained Emma.</p>

<p>“I presume it is the company I keep, and—”</p>

<p>“Your supper is ready, Mr. Haley,” called Grace.</p>

<p>The peanut man did full justice to the meal prepared for him, and, while
he ate, the Overlanders plied him with questions. Ham White sat back and
regarded their guest with interest. White was keen, and little escaped
his alert eyes.</p>

<p>“That fellow is bluffing!” was his mental comment. “I wonder what his
game is.”</p>

<p>“Now that you have no horse, what are you going to do?” asked Hippy.</p>

<p>“Sell peanuts! I’ll take your orders now.”</p>

<p>The peanut man did, and when he had finished, each member of the party
had given him an order for a bag of peanuts, Stacy being the only one
whose order was a gift. From then on until bedtime the visitor rattled
on, keeping the party convulsed with laughter. In the conversations that
followed the evening’s entertainment, Jim Haley succeeded in drawing
from them the story of their experiences in the brief time that they had
been out, and discovered that he was not talking with greenhorns.</p>

<p>Mr. Haley was particularly interested in Miss Briggs’ experiences with
the bandits at the ranger cabin, and questioned her in detail as to the
appearances of the riders.</p>

<p>“Probably the same fellows that held me up,” he observed, stroking his
chin. “You say the old prospector had something that they wanted to get
possession of?” he asked, turning to Elfreda.</p>

<p>She answered with a slight incline of the head.</p>

<p>“What was it?” The question was direct and incisively put.</p>

<p>“Being a lawyer, and having my client’s interests at heart, I decline to
permit her to answer,” returned Elfreda, which brought a hearty laugh
from the party, Jim Haley laughing more loudly than any of the others.</p>

<p>Hamilton White’s face hardened ever so little.</p>

<p>“Your questions are rather personal, and I must ask you to be more
discreet,” he rebuked.</p>

<p>“A thousand pardons!” bowed the visitor. “For this indiscretion, I shall
include some handsome oil paintings, which we give only to big jobbers
with large orders for International Peanuts Products, when I fill the
orders you have been so magnanimous as to favor me with.”</p>

<p>“That’s a mighty indigestible word, that magnanimous thing. Don’t put
anything like that in the shipment with my peanuts,” declared Stacy.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say you don’t know the meaning of that word?”
exclaimed Nora.</p>

<p>“Can’t say that I do,” answered Stacy carelessly. “What does it mean,
Emma?”</p>

<p>“Your education has been neglected. Any schoolboy ought to know the
meaning of a word so common as that,” returned Emma airily.</p>

<p>“All right, you tell us. I’ll swallow whatever you say—once!”</p>

<p>“Why, magnanimous means—it means—it means—Pshaw, I know what it means
perfectly well, but somehow I can’t properly explain it.” Emma’s face
was growing red. “Oh, Hamilton, you tell my ignorant companion what—”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha, ha!” chortled the fat boy. “You tell him, Hamilton.”</p>

<p>Grace and Elfreda were laughing immoderately, and Hippy was chuckling to
himself. All knew that Miss Dean knew the meaning of the word, but that
Stacy, with his question, had confused her.</p>

<p>“I believe the dictionary explains it as being elevated in soul,”
answered the guide smilingly.</p>

<p>“Oh, Hamilton, isn’t that wonderful?” breathed Emma. “It sounds so
utterly poetic.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t think so were you to swallow it with a bag of peanuts,”
grumbled the fat boy.</p>

<p>And after the laughter had subsided, Grace announced that she was tired
and said she would turn in.</p>

<p>“Do we make an early start in the morning, Mr. White?” she asked,
turning smilingly towards the guide.</p>

<p>“Yes, if that is agreeable to you, Mrs. Gray,” was the courteous reply.
The easy grace of this man, and the evident culture that was beneath the
surface, had puzzled Grace Harlowe from the beginning. There was that
about him that was mysterious, unfathomable. These thoughts were in the
Overland girl’s mind as she turned towards the little tent which she and
Elfreda occupied together.</p>

<p>“By the way, Mr. Haley,” she added, halting at the tent opening, “Mr.
White will fix you up for the night with a blanket. If you will bunk in
with Lieutenant Wingate, there is room. Mr. White prefers to sleep in
the open.”</p>

<p>“So do I. In the vast open, with the ambient atmosphere enveloping me
like a blanket, I can ponder over the psychology of merchandising
peanuts better than when I am shut in. All nature assists, the saplings
sap and seep into my brain, into my subconscious being, and the leaves
leave their native habitat to come to my aid, and—”</p>

<p>“One can’t blame them so much for that,” observed Emma. “Good-night, Mr.
Haley; good-night, Hamilton; good-night, all.”</p>

<p>“Either that man is a lunatic or else he is a big fraud,” declared
Elfreda, entering the tent. “Which is it?”</p>

<p>“Just another mystery, that is all,” answered Grace good-naturedly. “Why
worry about him?”</p>

<p>“I don’t. I have sufficient troubles of my own to keep me from sleeping
soundly.”</p>

<p>By this time the others were turning in; the visitor had already rolled
himself up in a blanket with feet to the fire, and Ham White was out
seeing that the ponies were secure for the night. He remained out there
for a long time, looking up at the tree tops, dimly discernible in the
faint light. At the same time he appeared to be listening, now and then
glancing back at the silent figure of Jim Haley.</p>

<p>At last the guide turned and strode back into camp, and threw his
blanket down beside Haley. But White did not lie down at once. Instead,
he crouched down beside the visitor and peered down into the man’s face.
A pair of twinkling eyes were gazing up at him.</p>

<p>“You are awake, eh? I rather thought you would be. Now who are you, and
what is your game? Out with it or out you go!”</p>

<p>“Who am I? I am G 16, and I want to talk with you!” Haley’s voice sank
to a whisper as he made the mysterious announcement.</p>

<p>Ham White uttered an exclamation, then, quickly collecting himself, he
lay down on his blanket close to the peanut salesman, and for the next
half hour the two men spoke in earnest tones, tones too low for the
Overlanders to hear.</p>

<p>It was long after midnight, when, had one been awake, he might have
discovered a shadowy figure slinking along at the rear of the camp. It
first paused at the tent occupied by Hippy and Stacy, then crept on all
fours to the one in which Grace and Elfreda were sleeping. These little
tents were open at both ends, though they could be closed in the event
of a storm, and a person at either end, by peering closely, could see
the heads and faces of the occupants.</p>

<p>Inch by inch the shadow, now flat on the ground, wriggled towards the
two sleeping girls. A lean hand reached cautiously under, first Grace’s
pillow, then under Elfreda’s. The pillows were pneumatic pillows that
were filled with air before retiring, and were soft and comfortable, as
well as sensitive to the touch.</p>

<p>The pressure of the shadow’s hand under the pillow disturbed Elfreda
Briggs, and her eyes slowly opened, but she did not move, believing that
the hand belonged to her companion. A sidelong glance, however, told her
that Grace’s back was towards her, therefore the hand could not belong
to her. Elfreda’s next thought was that Stacy Brown was trying to play
pranks on her.</p>

<p>In the meantime the hand crept slowly about under the pillow. It was
time to act, and Miss Briggs, half raising herself on one elbow, made a
grab for it. She grasped a bare muscular arm.</p>

<p>“Overland!” cried the girl, and the familiar thrilling call of distress
awakened every person in the camp with the exception of Stacy Brown.
Then darkness overwhelmed Elfreda and she knew no more.</p>

<p>Grace, awakened by the cry, threw her arms about the neck of her
companion.</p>

<p>“Elfreda! Elfreda! What is it?”</p>

<p>There was no reply.</p>

<p>“Overland! Quick! Something has happened to Elfreda!” she cried,
springing from her blanket, as the quick, sharp report of a revolver
smote the ears of the campers.</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XI</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>BELIEVERS IN SAFETY FIRST</span>
</h2>

<p>Bang! Bang! Bang! The air seemed filled with explosions of rifles and
revolvers, and the Overland camp was in an uproar in a moment, even
Stacy Brown rousing himself sufficiently to sit up and take quick
notice. The instant the shooting began Stacy, concluding that his
services were not needed, lay down with his blanket drawn up over his
head.</p>

<p>“Safety first,” muttered the boy as a bullet tore a hole through his
little dog tent. “Wow! I wonder what all the excitement is about?”</p>

<p>Grace and Stacy were the only ones of the outfit who had not run out
following the alarm. Grace had turned her pocket lamp on Elfreda’s face.
It was a pallid face that she looked upon.</p>

<p>“Elfreda! Elfreda! What is it?” begged Grace. “Oh, what is it?”</p>

<p>Miss Briggs was breathing, but was unconscious.</p>

<p>The shooting died away as suddenly as it had started, and then Emma and
Nora ran to Grace’s tent, crying out to know what had happened.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, girls. Please hold the light so I can examine her. I
heard Elfreda scream, then came the shooting, and that is all I know
about it,” answered Grace. Her nimble fingers ran over her companion’s
head, neck and shoulders, for Grace’s experience in the hospital service
in France had not only made her efficient in emergencies, but had taught
her to keep her own self well in hand.</p>

<p>“Ah! Here it is.”</p>

<p>“Wha—what!” gasped Nora.</p>

<p>“A lump on the top of her head, well down near the forehead. She has
been dealt a heavy blow, but with what, I can’t say. Fetch water. We
must try to revive her.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Hippy Wingate came running up at this juncture, revolver in
hand.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Elfreda has been knocked out,” Nora told him.</p>

<p>“With what?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Hippy,” spoke up Grace. “Please go away. This is no place
for you. Stand by in case we need you. Where is the guide?”</p>

<p>“He is trying to find out if there are prowlers about here. I think he
found someone, for I heard a man yell,” Hippy informed them as he left
the tent.</p>

<p>Reviving Elfreda was a matter of only a few minutes after they began
bathing her face and rubbing her body. Grace then uttered a sigh of
relief.</p>

<p>“What—what happened to you?” stammered Emma.</p>

<p>“Don’t question her now. Can’t you see that she is weak?” rebuked Grace.
“Lie perfectly quiet, dear. You can talk later,” admonished Grace, as
Miss Briggs indicated that she had something to say. “You girls had
better step out and give us a few moments’ quiet,” she advised. “Hippy,
if it is prudent, you had better start up the fire,” she called. “We
must have light and warm water. Where is Stacy?”</p>

<p>Hippy said he had not seen the fat boy, and then went straight to
Stacy’s tent, where he found him still practicing safety first. Hippy
dragged Stacy out by the feet.</p>

<p>“Leggo! Wow!” howled Stacy. “Oh, it’s you, is it?” he added. “What do
you mean by waking up a fellow like this? Anything wrong?” he questioned
innocently.</p>

<p>“Oh, no; nothing at all. Everything is peaceful and quiet. You get out
and help me build a fire, and be lively about it, too. I’m not in the
mood to trifle with you.”</p>

<p>While Hippy and Stacy were building a fire, the two girls, Emma and
Nora, got water to be heated. Grace bathed Miss Briggs’ feet in the hot
water, for the injured girl was in a chill. A lump of sizable
proportions had formed on her head. This was dressed by Grace, and in a
short time Miss Briggs was asleep. Grace then stepped outside to her
companions who were standing about the fire.</p>

<p>“Hasn’t Mr. White come in yet?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“I haven’t seen him. Has J. Elfreda said anything yet?” questioned
Hippy.</p>

<p>“Not about what happened. If she awakens again, and is then able to
talk, I will question her. Please let me know when Mr. White comes in.”</p>

<p>It was some time later when the guide returned. Elfreda had been awake
from her brief sleep long enough to tell Grace what she knew of the
occurrence.</p>

<p>“Mr. White, what do you know about this?” asked Grace.</p>

<p>“Not a thing. The first I knew of anything being wrong was when someone
called, followed by a cry. I think it was Miss Briggs who first cried
out.”</p>

<p>Grace nodded.</p>

<p>“As I got on my feet I saw a man running, and knowing that it could be
none of our party running away, I fired at him. I don’t think I hit him.
He returned the fire, but at that juncture Lieutenant Wingate began
shooting. Lieutenant, I’ll say you aren’t slow about getting into
action. It was bully. Then I chased the man and he and I both emptied
our revolvers at each other. One of us hit him—”</p>

<p>“It was your shot, Ham,” interrupted Hippy. “I wasn’t shooting when he
cried out.”</p>

<p>“Then you didn’t get the fellow?” demanded Grace, addressing the guide.</p>

<p>“No. He got away. I wish it had been daylight. That is all I can tell
you. May I ask what Miss Briggs has to say of the attack on her?”</p>

<p>“She says she felt something moving under her pillow, and after waiting
a moment she became convinced that a hand was searching there. She made
a grab for the hand and caught a man’s arm and then lost consciousness.”</p>

<p>“Fright?” asked the guide.</p>

<p>“Fright! No. A blow on the head, Mr. White. I think the fellow must have
brought his fist down, for the injury doesn’t look as if it had been
done with a stick or an instrument. That is all she knows about it,
sir.”</p>

<p>“Was anything taken—did she have anything under her pillow?” persisted
White.</p>

<p>“Yes. That little canvas bag she carries. There was nothing of value in
it. There may have been some small change there, for most of her money
was in her money belt around her waist. The other things in the bag were
such toilet articles as we all carry to use while riding—and a little
powder,” added Grace smilingly. “Mere men don’t understand those
things.”</p>

<p>“Thieves!” cried Stacy. “Oh, wow!” The fat boy ran to his tent and
feverishly searched his clothing. He was back in a few moments. “I knew
it! The thief didn’t dare tackle a real man. You see, he picked out weak
women. He knew better than to trifle with Stacy Brown.”</p>

<p>“Even if Stacy Brown did hide under a blanket when the show opened,”
supplemented Lieutenant Wingate. “I presume, if Elfreda had not given
the alarm, the man would have gone through all our belongings.”</p>

<p>Ham White was pacing up and down. They could see that he was disturbed.</p>

<p>“The low-down cur!” he breathed, clenching his fists, his face set and
slightly paler than usual.</p>

<p>“Hamilton! Hamilton! Don’t disturb yourself so,” begged Emma
solicitously. “Be calm, do. I will demonstrate for you.”</p>

<p>“Aw, let the peanut man do the demonstrating,” jeered Stacy. “Your
demonstrating might do at a family picnic, but up here it is punk!”</p>

<p>White gave no heed to Emma’s sympathetic words. He stood with lowered
chin thinking.</p>

<p>“The peanut man!” cried Nora.</p>

<p>“Yes. Where is Mr. Haley, Mr. White?” demanded Grace.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Mrs. Gray,” replied the guide slowly. “I thought he was
sleeping beside me when I sprang up. I haven’t seen him since,” added
Ham White, bending over to poke the fire.</p>

<p>The Overlanders looked at each other, and each knew what the other was
thinking about.</p>

<p>“Some demonstrator, that fellow,” observed Stacy Brown. “I’m mighty glad
that he didn’t demonstrate over that fifty-cent piece in my trousers
pocket.”</p>

</h2>

<p>“We might as well move on,” advised Grace. “To-morrow will be Sunday,
and we ought to find a good camping place for that day, and have a day
of rest.”</p>

<p>“Does Miss Briggs feel able to ride?” asked Ham White.</p>

<p>“Yes. Her head naturally is still quite sore, but otherwise she is as
fit as any of us. It takes a lot to put J. Elfreda Briggs out of
commission,” added Grace laughingly.</p>

<p>“That it does,” agreed Elfreda herself, emerging from her tent with a
head bandage like a turban.</p>

<p>The party were just gathering for breakfast on the morning after the
attack on Elfreda. She was a little pale, but wholly herself. The
Overlanders all shook hands with her as she came out, Ham White among
the number, and, for the instant of the hand-clasp, their eyes met, each
seeking in the fleeting look to read the secret of the other’s reserve.</p>

<p>“I have been out since break of day, following the trail of our
prowler,” announced White. “There was more than one man involved in the
game, whatever it was. They had horses, three horses, and there must
have been that many men involved, though only one man entered the camp.
The probabilities are that they reasoned one man would stand a better
chance to carry out their plan without detection than would a bunch of
them, and they undoubtedly were right. One of our shots, as I said last
night, hit the fellow, for I found a trail of blood drops. Their trail
shows that he had to be assisted to his saddle, and that a companion
rode along at his side when they went away.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Hamilton. Did you demonstrate all of that?” begged Emma, her eyes
filled with admiration.</p>

<p>“I read the trail, that’s all,” replied the guide. “If that is
demonstrating, I demonstrated.”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” laughed Stacy.</p>

<p>“Stacy Brown, you are a young ruffian!” cried Emma indignantly.</p>

<p>“I know it.”</p>

<p>“Besides, you show the most abject cowardice whenever courage is called
for. Why not be like Mr. White, afraid of nothing?”</p>

<p>“I suppose Ham’s a hero, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes, you know he is,” agreed Emma, her face relaxing into a happy
smile.</p>

<p>“Well, he didn’t do anything to save Elfreda’s life, did he?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not directly. Indirectly he did.”</p>

<p>“Then I am the heroest hero of the two. Elfreda, didn’t I save your
life—directly—when that bandit was shooting at—” Stacy checked himself.
“I leave it to this honorable bunch if I am not entitled to the cross of
war with all the palms on it that the old thing will hold. I demand a
rising vote.”</p>

<p>All except Emma got up, and all were laughing heartily.</p>

<p>“Carried! We will now proceed to replenish the coal bin,” announced
Stacy, resuming his breakfast.</p>

<p>Emma had nothing further to say to him, though Stacy regarded her with
large, soulful eyes during most of the meal. Following breakfast, the
men of the party broke camp and rolled the packs, and in a very short
time they were on their way.</p>

<p>Grace and Elfreda rode side by side, Grace wishing to see to it that her
companion did not overdo herself.</p>

<p>“I haven’t had an opportunity to ask you if the thief got anything of
value?” asked Grace.</p>

<p>“No. The diary was not in the bag. I put it under my money belt when I
turned in,” Elfreda informed her.</p>

<p>“Good for you! I have been thinking that you and I should look through
that book carefully, and if there be information of value in it, we
should make a copy of it. You keep the original and I will keep the
copy.”</p>

<p>Miss Briggs said she didn’t care much what happened to the diary, save
that she did not like the idea of being beaten.</p>

<p>“I hope I am too good a lawyer to give up a case until the jury has
brought in a verdict against me. Then, after I have carried it to the
higher court and have been defeated there, then I’m beaten. But not
until then. What about the peanut man? Grace, is he the guilty one?”</p>

<p>“Ask Hamilton White. He knows,” was the low-spoken reply.</p>

<p>“Why do you say that?”</p>

<p>“From the expression of his face when I asked about Haley. There is
something about those men that I do not clearly understand.”</p>

<p>Elfreda averred that there were several “somethings” that needed
clearing up.</p>

<p>“My dear Elfreda, we are involved in so many mysteries that, first thing
we know, we will be accusing each other. To-morrow being Sunday, I
suggest that we go over the diary—get off somewhere by ourselves and
make a thorough job of it,” suggested Grace, to which Elfreda agreed
with a nod.</p>

<p>Grace, at this juncture, turned in her saddle to see what had become of
Stacy, who had been lagging behind all the morning. He was not in sight
when she looked, but the next time she turned he was observed back some
distance, riding off the trail a little way, leaning over and catching
bushes in his hands.</p>

<p>“I wonder what mischief that boy is up to now?” murmured Grace. “Surely
he is not doing that solely for exercise.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think he needs exercise?” questioned Miss Briggs with a
smile.</p>

<p>Grace’s answer was a laugh.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless I owe Stacy Brown an obligation that I never can repay,”
added Elfreda gravely, and to this Grace gave an emphatic assent.</p>

<p>The day’s journey was without incident, and was thoroughly enjoyed. Many
trails were crossed, some of which Hamilton White halted to examine, and
then proceeded on his way without comment, unless he gave an opinion to
Hippy Wingate who was riding beside him. Emma Dean kept as close to the
guide as possible, and watched him as though fearing that he might get
away from her. The guide, however, gave only the most ordinary attention
to Emma, just as he did to the others of the party.</p>

<p>“Is there much gold up this way, or is it a myth?” Hippy was asking him,
as the fat boy continued with his operations at the rear of the line of
horses.</p>

<p>“There undoubtedly is plenty of it if one knew where or how to find it.
I never did, never expect to, and don’t know that I should care to. In
my experience I have learned that not only is gold an elusive substance,
but that it seldom brings the finder happiness. Ordinarily it brings him
disaster, even death!”</p>

<p>“Whew! You talk like an actor playing in a tragedy,” observed Lieutenant
Wingate.</p>

<p>The guide grinned and resumed his study of the trail. Hippy had thought
there might be opportunity to draw Hamilton White out as to his career.
The Overlander was positive that it would prove an interesting story,
but no opportunity presented itself on this occasion, so Hippy prudently
kept his questions to himself. Emma, however, kept up an almost
continuous chatter all the morning and most of the afternoon.</p>

<p>As the day waned, they began urging their horses to a faster pace, White
explaining that he wished to reach a certain camp-site that day. He said
it would make an ideal Sunday rest camp.</p>

<p>“Do you think we shall be safe there?” questioned Emma. “Oh, I hope so,
Hamilton.”</p>

<p>“As safe there as anywhere up here—perhaps more so, for we shall be on
high ground where nothing can get to us, at least in daylight, without
our observing the approach.”</p>

<p>“You know the place, then?” suggested Hippy. “Have you been there
before?”</p>

<p>“No.” The answer was brief and final, and Hippy wondered how Ham could
know about a particular spot in the forest, and lead them directly to it
if he never had been there. Hippy could find no answer to that.</p>

<p>The Overland Riders reached the site just before sundown. The country
about them was mountainous and heavily forested. Back of the camp
towered a huge rock. A little way from it was a smooth level spot, and
bubbling from the rock itself there came a stream of water almost at ice
temperature, as they discovered when drinking cups were brought and all
hands helped themselves.</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Grace. “Is there any drink in the world to equal it?”</p>

<p>“Not now,” answered Hippy Wingate.</p>

<p>“And never has been,” nodded Miss Briggs.</p>

<p>The guide gave expression to a wry smile and went on about his work of
preparing for a week-end camp. Lieutenant Wingate attended to the
unloading, the equipment being piled in orderly manner, and, after a
time, Stacy was prodded into assisting him.</p>

<p>“Mercy! What a peculiar odor there is here,” exclaimed Grace. “Don’t you
smell it, girls?”</p>

<p>Nora, Emma and Elfreda sniffed the air.</p>

<p>“Hippy, what is it? Don’t you smell something disagreeable?” demanded
Nora.</p>

<p>“Now that you speak of it, I do. Stacy, see if you can find anything
dead about here.”</p>

<p>“The place is all dead,” growled the fat boy. “No excitement, no
nothing. But there may be, there may be.”</p>

<p>“May be what?” asked Hippy, regarding the boy keenly.</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing much. I was just thinking.” Stacy avoided Hippy’s eyes, for
his was a guilty conscience. Stacy Brown had been making an experiment,
but as yet he did not know whether or not it was going to produce
satisfactory results. He saw Hamilton White give him a slanting glance
out of the corners of his eyes, and got busy at once unrolling packs and
laying out the tents. This alone should have been sufficient to arouse
the suspicion of the Overland Riders, for the fat boy never worked
unless for some particular reason of his own. The others of the party
were too busy to notice him, and after a time they became used to the
strange odor, faint at times and then strong, as the evening breeze
stirred it into life.</p>

<p>At supper, however, they did find it most unpleasant, and Lieutenant
Wingate discovered that the odor was always more noticeable in the
vicinity of Stacy, but he made no comment. The guide some time before
that had made a similar discovery.</p>

<p>Immediately after the evening meal, Mr. White made a survey of their
surroundings, including a visit to the top of the big rock. From there
he found what he expected to find, an excellent view of the mountains
and the forest for many miles about, but the light was fading, and he
deferred further survey until the morning when the light would be right
to see much farther.</p>

<p>The Riders were tired after their long day’s ride, so all hands turned
in early, and were asleep in a few moments, except the fat boy. Stacy,
by frequent pinchings of himself, and chuckling over the fun he might
have were his experiment to prove a success, managed to keep awake.</p>

<p>Giving his companions ample time to sink into a profound sleep, the fat
boy crept from his blanket, moving very cautiously so as not to awaken
Hippy Wingate. Once outside he took a long look at the form of Hamilton
White who lay rolled in his blanket near the campfire, for the air was
now chill. White was plainly asleep.</p>

<p>Stacy crept to Grace’s tent, then to the one occupied by Nora and Emma,
pausing for a moment at each and performing some peculiar motions. It
would have been difficult for anyone to even guess at what the boy might
be up to.</p>

<p>“I’d like to give that guide fellow a dose, too,” muttered the fat boy,
again pausing for a long look at White. “I reckon I’d better let well
enough alone, though.”</p>

<p>Stacy got back to his own tent without awakening a single member of the
party.</p>

<p>“Humph!” he muttered. “Sleepy-heads, all. Anybody could walk in here and
steal them without awakening a single person. I don’t believe anything
is going to happen at all. That fellow down at Cresco is a fake, and
I’ll be even with him when we get back there. I’ll get my money back
or—or—” Stacy Brown’s eyes closed, his mutterings became mere murmurs
and then ceased altogether. He, too, was sound asleep, the biggest
sleepy-head of them all.</p>

<p>It was several hours after that that something happened.</p>

<p>Emma Dean uttered a terrified scream, and Nora Wingate, suddenly
awakened, screamed louder than Emma did. The two girls bounded from
their beds and ran from the tent hysterically crying for help.</p>

<p>“Hamilton! Oh, Hamilton!” cried Emma.</p>

<p>The guide had sprung to his feet at the first scream. Grace and Elfreda
were only a few seconds behind him.</p>

<p>“Merciful heaven! What is it?” cried Miss Briggs, as her eyes saw what
appeared to be a huge form at the tent entrance.</p>

<p>Both girls ran out at the other end of the tent, then Hamilton White’s
rifle spoke, waking the echoes of the forest, just as Stacy Brown ran
from his own tent in a terrible fright.</p>

<p>“Oh, wow, wow, wow!” howled the fat boy. “He got me, he did.”</p>

<p>Stacy’s experiment had proved an entire success, and he had fallen a
victim to his own prank.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='chXIII' title='XIII: The Camp is Invaded'>
  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XIII</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>THE CAMP IS INVADED</span>
</h2>

<p>“Don’t run. Keep together back of me. Lieutenant, look out for the rear.
I’ll take care of the rest,” shouted the guide.</p>

<p>“What is it? Hamilton, what is it?” cried Emma.</p>

<p>“Bears!” answered Grace Harlowe. “I never saw so many in all my life.
What does it mean?”</p>

<p>The camp was full of the beasts. They were ambling swiftly here and
there, growling, sniffing, pawing, and apparently without fear. This, as
some of the party knew, was not like the ways of the black bear.
Ordinarily a black bear cannot get away from man quickly enough. Even
the discharge of the guide’s rifle did not put the invaders to flight.</p>

<p>“Fire into their legs, Lieutenant,” directed White. “We don’t want to
kill them if we can avoid it. Besides, it is against the law.”</p>

<p>The two men let loose with their rifles at the feet of the beasts, but
in the faint light aim was uncertain, and it was only occasionally that
a grunt indicated that an animal had been hit.</p>

<p>Out in the bushes the ponies were snorting in fright. Stacy suddenly
uttered a yell as a bear ran between his legs and threw him down. From
the way the bear got away from him it was evident that the beast was as
badly frightened as was the fat boy. The swift work of White and Hippy
was having its effect, too, and here and there a dark form was observed
ambling away into the forest.</p>

<p>“Now! All together. We’ve got them going!” cried Ham White. “Be careful
that you don’t shoot towards the ponies.”</p>

<p>Stacy ran for his rifle, and a moment later he, too, was firing away,
and continued to fire until he was pulling the trigger on empty
chambers, but his assistance was no longer needed.</p>

<p>“I think they are all out now,” announced the guide. “I suspect that we
shall have some bear meat for breakfast just the same, but we can’t help
it. A man has a right to defend himself, though I always try to keep
within the law. Lieutenant, keep the camp clear while I build a fire so
we can see what we have.”</p>

<p>The coals of the evening fire were still smouldering, and it was the
work of but a few moments to start a blaze large enough to light up the
camp. The bears had torn and uprooted two tents and worked other havoc.
The camp was in a mess.</p>

<p>Hippy circled the camp.</p>

<p>“We got one of the beasts, a small one,” he called. “Sure we’ll have
bear meat for breakfast.”</p>

<p>White hurried to him.</p>

<p>“Nice fat fellow, too. We will dress him, and then we shall have to
guard the carcass or there will be none of it left by morning.”</p>

<p>“I think I’ll turn in, now that the excitement is all over,” announced
Stacy at this juncture.</p>

<p>“You will not. You will assist us to prepare the carcass or you get no
bear steak for breakfast.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care. I prefer venison anyway. Bear meat is too coarse for Emma
and me. We prefer something lighter, more spiritual.”</p>

<p>“<i>More</i> is the meat of your argument, as usual,” flung back Miss Dean.</p>

<p>With Hippy’s assistance the bear was hung up from a pole which was
thrust through its hocks, and White began deftly skinning it. The animal
was then dressed and left to cool.</p>

<p>The guide was perspiring freely and so was Hippy.</p>

<p>“Good work, Lieutenant. I reckon this isn’t the first time you have
dressed bear,” approved the guide.</p>

<p>“What now?” asked Hippy.</p>

<p>“You people had better go to bed. I shall sit up, for we may look for
visitors before daylight.”</p>

<p>“Visitors!” cried the Overlanders.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered White, smiling. “You will hear them, and after their
arrival there will be little sleep in this outfit.”</p>

<p>Hippy decided to remain on watch with the guide.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Brown!”</p>

<p>Stacy, on his way to his tent, halted at the guide’s call.</p>

<p>“Well, what is it?”</p>

<p>“Suppose you come over and tell us about it, so that we may laugh at the
joke, too.”</p>

<p>All eyes were turned on the fat boy.</p>

<p>“I’m going to bed,” protested Stacy sourly.</p>

<p>“Not now you are not,” decided Hippy sternly. “You come here. Now, Mr.
White, go on with the entertainment. I suspect we are going to hear
something. In fact, I already have a sneaking suspicion that there has
been something shady in this bear affair.”</p>

<p>“Where did you get the stuff?” began White.</p>

<p>“What stuff?”</p>

<p>“The bear-bait that you have been distributing along the way and in
camp?”</p>

<p>“I—I did—”</p>

<p>“Stacy!” rebuked Emma. “Be a good little George Washington now, and
confess to Hamilton that you cut down the cherry tree.”</p>

<p>“I realized that there was something familiar in the odor that we
detected here last evening, but I could not place it. That odor is here
now. It is bear-bait, and we have you to thank for our unexpected Sunday
dinner,” accused Ham White.</p>

<p>“Stacy Brown! Did you do that?” demanded Nora severely.</p>

<p>“Well, it was this way,” admitted the fat boy.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you tell me that you had the urge to do this terrible thing
so that I might demonstrate over you?” begged Emma.</p>

<p>“Oh, demonstrate over the wild animals.”</p>

<p>“That is what I have suggested,” reminded Emma. “The wild animal did not
give me the cue.”</p>

<p>“Go on, young man,” urged Hippy.</p>

<p>“I—I thought some bear meat might be appreciated by you folks, and of
course I knew we couldn’t shoot bear, as it is out of season, unless we
had to get rid of them. I—”</p>

<p>“Close your throttle! You are on the wrong division,” commanded Hippy.
“Where did you get that stuff—I mean the stuff that you planted to call
the bears?”</p>

<p>“Down at Cresco. I was talking with an old hunter who told me that he
used bear-bait, and could call bear to him at any time. He said I must
plaster it along the trail on bushes, and a few hours afterwards the
bear would come right to the camp, that you didn’t have to hunt them at
all. That is the way to hunt—wait for them to come to you. It is so much
simpler. Well, he had some of it and was willing to sell it to me for
five cart wheels—”</p>

<p>“Five what?” interrupted Nora.</p>

<p>“Cart wheels—dollars. I thought I had been stuck, but I wasn’t, was I?”
chuckled the fat boy. “Wait! I have some of it left in a can. I’ll get
it and show it to you,” offered Stacy, turning to run to his tent.</p>

<p>“No!” shouted the Overlanders.</p>

<p>Hippy grabbed the fat boy and hauled him back.</p>

<p>“We aren’t finished with you yet. Go on with the story. It is
interesting,” averred Hippy.</p>

<p>“I waited till you were all asleep, then I plastered the tents, and then
went to sleep. You know the rest. It worked, didn’t it?”</p>

<p>“It did,” agreed the guide. Ham White’s eyes were twinkling.</p>

<p>“Stacy Brown, aren’t you ashamed of yourself?” cried Nora Wingate.</p>

<p>“Ashamed? No, of course not. I am proud of myself. The trouble with you
folks is that you have no sense of humor. Even a Britisher would laugh
at this. I haven’t had time to laugh for myself, but I am going to now.”</p>

<p>Stacy did. He laughed uproariously and long, but there was little mirth
in his laughter. His motive was to put his companions in a frame of mind
that would make it easier for him, for Stacy secretly feared they would
take sweet revenge on him for his prank.</p>

<p>A brief period of silence followed the fat boy’s laughter, then the
Overlanders broke loose. Theirs was real mirth, and their laugh lasted
longer.</p>

<p>“Well, what are we going to do with him?” demanded Hippy.</p>

<p>“I reckon the young man is right about our lack of a sense of humor,”
agreed Ham. “We have had our laugh; we have some fine meat for
to-morrow, and we have had some excitement with no harm done except a
little loss of sleep and a somewhat mussed-up camp. My suggestion is
that if Mr. Brown will go bury that can of bear-bait, then sleep out in
the woods to-night, we will let him off this time. Well?”</p>

<p>“I’ll bury the stuff, yes, but I won’t sleep out in the woods. The bears
might get me,” objected Stacy. “One tried to, in my tent.”</p>

<p>“That is exactly the point that Hamilton is making,” spoke up Emma.
“Sleep out in the woods, by all means.”</p>

<p>A long, wailing cry echoed through the forest.</p>

<p>“Mercy! What’s that?” cried Nora.</p>

<p>“The coyotes have scented the fresh meat,” answered White. “They will
all be here soon, and some other beasts, too. Are you folks game for a
sight that will thrill you—that will show you the savagery of nature let
loose?” he asked quickly.</p>

<p>“Yes!” agreed the Overlanders eagerly. They did not know what he
proposed to do, but were ready for anything that he might suggest as a
diversion.</p>

<p>“Get your belongings, blankets, and such things as you don’t care to
lose. We men will get the horses, and—”</p>

<p>“Oh, have a heart!” begged Stacy. “What! Ride at this time of night? I
prefer to stay in camp.”</p>

<p>“You may,” agreed the guide.</p>

<p>Stacy sat down and regarded the preparations sourly, but when he saw
that his companions really were going to leave him, he ran for his pony
and his equipment. It was but a short time later that the party filed
out of camp, leading their horses, stepping out at a brisk walk, for
White was in some haste.</p>

<p>After proceeding several hundred yards from the camp, the guide halted.</p>

<p>“Tie your stock, and tie them securely, for we shall have to leave them
here alone for a time,” he directed.</p>

<p>This having been done, the party gathered together, waiting for Ham
White to direct them what to do next.</p>

<p>“We will wait here for the present,” he said.</p>

<p>Five, ten minutes of tense silence passed; then a long mournful howl
resounded through the forest. It was answered by other howls farther
away, then a scream brought rustlings in the tree-tops where the birds
stirred restlessly.</p>

<p>“They’re coming. Move forward cautiously; make no loud noises and be
careful where you step. No one is to use a weapon unless I tell him to
do so. Come!”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='chXIV' title='XIV: The Battle of the Beasts'>
  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XIV</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>THE BATTLE OF THE BEASTS</span>
</h2>

<p>“Oh, Hamilton!” said Emma, as she placed a trembling hand on the arm of
the guide.</p>

<p>“Be quiet,” he admonished.</p>

<p>The howls were coming nearer with the seconds, it seemed. There were
suggestive rustlings, and the faint sound of padded feet on the soft
ground somewhere to the right of the party.</p>

<p>The sensations of the Overland Riders were not wholly delightful, and
their nerves were tense and on edge.</p>

<p>The howls of the coyotes were mingled with snarls, and between
themselves and the faint light of the campfire the Overlanders now made
out slinking shadows.</p>

<p>“Mother of Mercy! What does it all mean?” murmured Nora Wingate.</p>

<p>“The coyotes are here,” Grace informed her. “Don’t be alarmed. They
cannot harm us if we keep together and don’t get panic-stricken.”</p>

<p>“Silence, please!” ordered White. “We will proceed. Pick your way.”</p>

<p>They had reached a point further on when the guide halted them.</p>

<p>“Look!” he said in a low tone of voice.</p>

<p>The Overlanders gazed on a scene such as they had never gazed upon
before.</p>

<p>A pack of coyotes were milling and snarling at the carcass of the
suspended bear. They were leaping and rending the bear’s flesh,
springing upon each other in their frenzy, biting and tearing their
fellows.</p>

<p>A long-drawn howl from the forest was followed by a chorus of yelps. The
air seemed full of hoarse wails.</p>

<p>“Wolves!” announced the guide briefly. “You can talk now. Your voices
can’t be heard by those beasts with all this uproar. How do you like
it?”</p>

<p>“It is terrible!” murmured Elfreda.</p>

<p>“Perhaps, but that is the way, not only of the beasts, but of man,
though man is more cruel. Life is a survival of the fittest. Look at the
trees and you have the answer. The tall ones are the vigorous ones; the
runts—”</p>

<p>The guide was interrupted by a scream that was almost human in its
quality.</p>

<p>“Ah! Now we shall see something worth while. Watch!” he warned.</p>

<p>What seemed to be a big ball of fur came hurtling from a tree, landing
right among the coyotes. Then followed the maddest battle and the
noisiest one that any member of the Overland party, with the possible
exception of Ham White, had ever seen.</p>

<p>“See the big cat give it to them!” cried the guide.</p>

<p>“The—the cat!” stammered Emma.</p>

<p>“Yes. That’s a mountain lion, which, as a matter of fact, is not a lion
at all.”</p>

<p>The girls were too thrilled with the scene before them to give heed to
his words.</p>

<p>The battle was brief, but when the lion finally leaped away with a large
chunk of meat in his jaws, three coyotes lay stretched out on the
ground. Whether the lion had killed them, or whether their own fellows
had done the deed, the eyes of the Overlanders had not been quick enough
to perceive. Now that they were rid of their enemy, the coyotes returned
to their savage feast.</p>

<p>“Say! You aren’t going to let those beasts eat up all our meat, are
you?” demanded Stacy. “I want some of that meat myself.”</p>

<p>“Is there any danger to us, Mr. White?” questioned a voice in the
guide’s ear.</p>

<p>He turned quickly, to find Miss Briggs standing at his side.</p>

<p>“No. We have our rifles, and so long as the bear meat holds out those
cowardly brutes can think of nothing else. We will give them something
to think about shortly, however. I think we have seen about enough of
this, and I am a little anxious about the ponies, too.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“You heard the wolves howling a little while ago. Well, you don’t hear
them now, do you?”</p>

<p>“Meaning?” interjected Grace.</p>

<p>“That they may be attacking the ponies or they may be stalking us—may at
this moment be within a few yards of us. I don’t worry about our safety.
They would have to be very hungry to attack us, in force as we are, but
let them overwhelm a pony and get him down, and he is lost.”</p>

<p>The guide paused, and peered through the leaves of a bunch of saplings
behind which the party was standing. He gazed steadily for a full
minute.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Gray, fix your gaze on that tree with the umbrella top. Do you get
it?” asked White eagerly.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Let me know if you see anything.”</p>

<p>“I see something dark on one of the projecting limbs,” answered Grace,
after a long look. “What is it?”</p>

<p>“An animal, probably a lion.”</p>

<p>“Ours?” questioned Hippy.</p>

<p>The guide shook his head.</p>

<p>“‘Ours’ as you call him is too full of bear meat at this moment to climb
a tree. He is probably still munching under a thick growth of creeping
juniper somewhere, and may remain there all night. That animal in the
umbrella tree must be another lion. Want to try your marksmanship on
him, Mrs. Gray? Take a shot at him,” urged Hamilton White. “This isn’t a
fair test, I know, for you can’t even see your rifle sights.”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, I’ll try it.” The members of the party, at the guide’s
direction, had brought along their rifles, as Ham knew that the weapons
might be needed. Grace stepped forward a little, moved to the right,
then to the left, each time peering over the barrel of her automatic
rifle. “I am not certain, but I think I can line up one sight. Shall I
fire?”</p>

<p>“Sure!” answered White.</p>

<p>The Overland girl knelt down and rested the rifle against the side of a
tree, but the position did not suit her, so she lay flat on her back on
the ground, with the weapon held between her elevated knees. It was for
only a few seconds that she waited, then there came a flash and a sharp
report, followed by a <i>spat</i>!</p>

<p>A snarl, and a faint squeal, came down to them.</p>

<p>“You hit the tree, and I shouldn’t be surprised if you barked the beast,
too!” cried Ham enthusiastically. “Try it again.”</p>

<p>“No. Give the others a chance. The one who brings down the beast shall
be free from all camp duties until Monday night,” suggested Grace.</p>

<p>“Here! Let me take a shot!” exclaimed Stacy. He raised his rifle,
without changing his position at all, and before the girls could ask an
opportunity to shoot, Stacy fired three quick shots.</p>

<p>A scream from the cat followed the shots. There was a lively scrambling
in the umbrella tree, and the dark object that Hamilton White had
pointed out disappeared for a few seconds. The party was too eager to
see the result of the shots to take their eyes from the tree for even a
second.</p>

<p>“There he comes!” cried Ham. “It’s a hit. Look at him tumble!”</p>

<p>The lion had plunged from the tree and was hurtling down. He struck the
ground with a loud whack, landing a few yards from the campfire, where
he lay kicking, then straightened out dead.</p>

<p>From the shots and the fall of the lion the coyotes got a fright that
sent them scurrying to the shadows.</p>

<p>“Now’s our chance to clear them out! Everybody shoot and shoot fast. No
danger of doing any damage, for our ponies are behind us!” ordered
White.</p>

<p>“Put down a barrage, you shooters, and give them a kick that will keep
them going. I want to go to bed,” cried Stacy. “I never shoot at
anything I can’t see. It isn’t sportsmanlike.”</p>

<p>Some lively shooting followed, and the camp and its immediate vicinity
was cleared of the vicious visitors in a few moments.</p>

<p>“We must get the ponies up in a hurry now, Lieutenant,” reminded Ham.
“You ladies stay out in the open, but keep together with rifles at
ready. Brown, you stay here and look after them. Shoot if anything
develops.”</p>

<p>The two men started back into the forest at a run, and they were just in
time, for slinking forms were already stalking the plunging, snorting
ponies.</p>

<p>It took but a few moments to free the ponies and lash them together with
lead ropes, whereupon the men started back to camp. They hesitated to
fire at the beasts, either coyotes or wolves, which were now stalking
the ponies, fearing to alarm the girls. Only a slight rustling indicated
the presence of the slinking beasts, and that sound continued until the
men with the ponies were more than half the way to the camp.</p>

<p>“Hark!” exclaimed the guide suddenly.</p>

<p>“Did you hear that, Lieutenant?”</p>

<p>“No. What was it?”</p>

<p>“Three shots. They weren’t from our camp, either—they were farther
away—and I should say from a revolver. Let us hurry on.”</p>

<p>A rifle crashed.</p>

<p>“That one was from our party. I’m going to cut loose. You bring the
horses in as best you can.” White cast off the lead rope, and dashed
ahead towards the camp, keeping his mount from burying its nose in the
ground by sheer muscular effort, as the little animal frequently
stumbled, and staggered over obstructions that could not be seen in the
darkness. The guide rode into camp at a swift gallop.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he demanded, sweeping the camp with a quick comprehensive
glance.</p>

<p>“There isn’t anything the matter,” answered Stacy Brown, who stood
leaning on his rifle.</p>

<p>“Then why did you shoot? I told you to shoot if anything developed,”
rebuked the guide.</p>

<p>“I didn’t say that I did shoot. However, for your own private ear, not
for general publication, I’ll say I did fire a shot. What about it?”
demanded the fat boy belligerently.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because some fellow was signalling us with small arms. Maybe some poor
fellow is lost. I have a big heart, sir—I am full to overflowing with
human sympathy, so I answered his shot.”</p>

<p>Hamilton White sighed. There was no answer that he could think of. Grace
laughed at him, and the guide grinned appreciatively.</p>

<p>Hippy arrived safely at camp with the horses a few moments later, and
was quickly informed of the cause of the shooting. Neither Hippy nor
White liked the thought of revealing their presence, for they knew that
peril might lurk in the big woods for the Overland Riders, and for that
reason they regretted Stacy’s shot.</p>

<p>“Well, I reckon you ladies had better turn in. We three men must clean
up the camp after the mussing it has had. How’s the cat?” asked the
guide.</p>

<p>“He is a nice fat fellow, Hamilton,” bubbled Emma.</p>

<p>“And Stacy made a wonderful shot, didn’t he, Mr. White?” spoke up
Elfreda enthusiastically.</p>

<p>“I always make wonderful shots,” boasted the fat boy. “Why, I could tell
you of shots that I have made that you wouldn’t believe possible were
anyone else to tell you the same story about himself.”</p>

<p>The Overlanders laughed heartily.</p>

<p>“Chance shot!” declared Hippy.</p>

<p>“I think so, too,” chirped Emma.</p>

<p>“I think I know a chance shot when I see one,” added Lieutenant Wingate.</p>

<p>“I don’t doubt it. You’ve made enough of them,” growled Stacy, and the
laugh was on Hippy. “I’m going to turn in. If the coyotes return don’t
bother to awaken me. I am perfectly able to take care of myself if they
get close enough.”</p>

<p>“You will help us clear up this camp, Stacy Brown!” ordered Hippy. Stacy
demurred, but obeyed. When Hippy assumed that tone, Stacy knew that it
was best to obey orders.</p>

<p>The three had been at work for only a few moments when a fusillade of
shots was heard. The shots were from small arms, and were much nearer
the camp than before. All work ceased instantly, and the guide looked
his displeasure at the interruption. He beckoned to the girls to go to
the far side of the camp, which they did without protest, but he
observed that they had picked up their rifles and laid them across their
laps, as they sat down in the shadows.</p>

<p>“Oh, Hamilton, do be careful,” called Emma.</p>

<p>Nora snickered, and Emma Dean elevated her chin disdainfully.</p>

<p>“Sh-h-h-h!” warned Grace. “I hear someone coming.”</p>

<p>“Help!” The cry was hard by the camp.</p>

<p>Ham White and Hippy, standing back from the light of the campfire, did
not move. Their rifles were held in the crooks of their left arms ready
for instant use.</p>

<p>“It may be a trick. Stand by!” warned White in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir,” answered Hippy.</p>

<p>A man, dishevelled, his clothing torn, his face bloody, staggered into
the camp.</p>

<p>“I’m done for!” he gasped, and collapsed in a heap.</p>

</h2>

<p>“Look out!” was White’s warning to Lieutenant Wingate, as the guide
sprang forward to the man on the ground.</p>

<p>“Is he dead?” called Elfreda, getting up to go forward to the visitor’s
assistance.</p>

<p>“No. Stay where you are for the present, please.” The camp was silent
for a moment, then White stood up. “It’s Jim Haley!” he announced. “And
he has been pretty roughly used.”</p>

<p>“The Man from Seattle!” cried the girls. Elfreda was at his side
instantly.</p>

<p>“Is he wounded?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I think not,” replied the guide.</p>

<p>“See if he has any peanuts with him,” advised Stacy Brown.</p>

<p>“Stacy!” Hippy’s voice was stern, and the fat boy subsided.</p>

<p>A quick examination by White and Miss Briggs failed to reveal any
wounds. They brought water, and Elfreda bathed Haley’s face, which,
though bloody, was only scratched, probably by contact with bushes. It
took but a short time to revive him, his trouble being almost wholly
exhaustion. Grace hastened to make a pot of tea, which Haley gulped down
and instantly recovered himself.</p>

<p>“Sorry I lost my samples, or I’d not have been in this shape,” he said,
grinning.</p>

<p>“What happened to you?” Hippy asked.</p>

<p>“Same old story. The mountain ruffians wanted peanuts, so they tackled
me. One taste of the International’s product and men will commit murder
to get more of it. I threw away all I had, and they’re picking them up
along the trail. It was the only way I could get rid of the scoundrels.
Then I got into more trouble. A pack of wolves got the scent of the
peanuts and they tackled me, too, but I hadn’t any of the
International’s product to throw to them, so I had to run for it. They
chased me nearly all the way in. ‘Good for man and beast’ is the slogan
that I shall send on to the International for use in their publicity
matter.”</p>

<p>The girls were now laughing heartily, but, as they recalled the manner
of Haley’s leaving them, they subsided abruptly. Haley’s now merry eyes
caught the significance of the change.</p>

<p class='caption'>“I’m Done For!”</p>
</div>

<p>“What have I said or done now? Is it because I have no peanuts for you
good people?”</p>

<p>“I think the young ladies would like an explanation of your sudden
departure the other night,” spoke up Hippy Wingate.</p>

<p>“Were I to tell you that I ran away because I was afraid, you probably
would not believe me, so I’ll not tell you that. There are some things
one can speak of freely, and others that he cannot. This latter happens
to be my difficulty now. If you feel that you do not want me, of course
I shall not impose upon you. I thank you, but I warn you that you are
not to enjoy any of the International’s product until you reach home.
They eat ’em alive up here.”</p>

<p>“You are quite welcome to remain as long as you wish. Please stay over
Sunday with us, Mr. Haley,” requested Grace. “We hope to have a spread
for our Sunday dinner,” she added laughingly.</p>

<p>“You win, Mrs. Gray. Unfortunately, my International raiment is in a sad
condition, but if you will lend me a pair of shears I’ll cut off the
ragged ends and try to make myself presentable.”</p>

<p>The girls, at this juncture, bade the men good-night and turned in, for
there were not many hours left for sleep, and they were now very tired
after the exciting night through which they had passed.</p>

<p>A few words passed between the guide and the peanut man, and Ham White
listened with a heavy frown on his face.</p>

<p>“I won’t do it!” he exclaimed. “Do you think you would were you in my
position?”</p>

<p>“If the International’s product didn’t pay me I should,” answered the
peanut man, with a twinkle in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh, hang the International!” retorted White. “I give you fair warning
that I’ll not double-cross these young women for you or for any of your
confounded outfit. I’ve done enough already, and I am thinking of going
to them and making a clean breast of what I have done and then get out.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be a fool, White. Here! Read this.” Haley extended a folded slip
of paper to the guide, who opened and read it, the frown deepening on
his forehead.</p>

<p>White handed back the slip of paper, and resting his chin in the palm of
his hand sat regarding the distant campfire thoughtfully, for they had
withdrawn out of earshot of the camp for their conversation.</p>

<p>“Very well!” agreed Hamilton White after a few moments’ reflection. “I
might as well be hanged for a sheep as a wolf, but if anything happens
here as a result I shall tell why. Remember that, Haley.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, what’s a bag of peanuts more or less?” was the enigmatic
reply of the Man from Seattle. “I’ll take a nip of sleep, if you don’t
mind, and be on my way, but not <i>far</i> away.”</p>

<p>The queer visitor took the blanket that had been given to him, and,
walking back into the forest a short distance from the camp, lay down
and went to sleep. The guide did not turn in at all, but sat silently in
the shadows, rifle at his side, thinking and listening. Thus the rest of
the night passed, and day began to dawn.</p>

<p>With the breaking of the day Hamilton White climbed the miniature
mountain, and drawing a single-barreled glass from his pocket began
studying the landscape. A tiny spiral of smoke about two miles to the
north claimed his instant attention. He studied it for a few moments. At
first the smoke was quite dark, then the spiral grew thin and gray as it
waved lazily on the still morning air.</p>

<p>“Someone is building a breakfast fire,” he muttered. “And they know how
to build a fire, too. That may be Haley’s crowd. Ah!”</p>

<p>As White slowly swept his glass around he discovered something else that
aroused his keen interest. On a distant mountain a flag was being
wigwagged. He could not see the operator of it, but he was able to
follow the message that was being spelled out.</p>

<p>Another shift of his glass and a careful study of known localities
enabled the guide to find the person who was receiving the message, and
soon the receiver began answering with his signal flag.</p>

<p>Ham White grinned as he read both messages.</p>

<p>“The forest eyes of Uncle Sam!” he murmured. The signalers were forest
lookouts whose eyes were constantly on the alert watching over the vast
forest within their range for suspicious smokes, and they were having a
friendly Sunday morning conversation over a distance of nearly four
miles.</p>

<p>Ham read and smiled.</p>

<p>“If they knew they would be more careful of what they said,” he
chuckled, then a few moments later he climbed down, returned to camp and
started the breakfast fire. He fried some strips of bacon, put on the
coffee, and then he sounded the breakfast call.</p>

<p>“Come and get it!” was the call that rang out on the mountain air.</p>

<p>The Overlanders thought they wanted to sleep, in fact, they were hardly
awake when they got lip grumbling, in most instances, and began
hurriedly dressing. All were shivering, for the air was very chill. The
odor of the breakfast, when they smelled it, added to the haste of their
dressing.</p>

<p>“Stick your heads in the cold water and you will be all right,” advised
the guide.</p>

<p>The girls returned from the spring, their faces rich with color, eyes
sparkling, and ready for breakfast.</p>

<p>“How are the appetites? I don’t ask you, Mr. Brown. You have proved to
my satisfaction that you can eat whether you are hungry or not,” laughed
White.</p>

<p>“We are ready for breakfast, sir,” answered Elfreda Briggs. “My, but it
does smell good.” “Where is Mr. Haley?” questioned Grace, regarding the
guide with a look of inquiry in her eyes.</p>

<p>“He thought best to sleep outside of the camp, and no doubt has gone on
before this.”</p>

<p>“Why, Mr. White?” persisted Grace.</p>

<p>“That is a question that I can’t answer just now, Mrs. Gray,” returned
the guide, meeting her eyes in a level gaze.</p>

<p>“Oh, very well. We will have breakfast.”</p>

<p>“We will,” agreed Stacy, and began to help himself from the frying pan,
when the guide smilingly placed a hand on the fat boy’s arm.</p>

<p>“You forget the ladies, Mr. Brown,” he reminded.</p>

<p>“Forget them? How could I?”</p>

<p>“It is you who forget, Hamilton,” interposed Emma. “You forget that
Stacy Brown never was brought up.”</p>

<p>“Give me the chuck!” whispered Stacy. “Heap the plate.”</p>

<p>White, catching the significance of the request, heaped the plate, and
Stacy bore it to Emma with great dignity. He bowed low and offered the
plate.</p>

<p>“Your highness is served,” he said. “If you will be so kind as to call
your sweet soul to earth from the ethereal realms above long enough to
feed that sweet soul on a few fat slices of common pig, you will be a
real human being. I thank you,” added the boy, as Emma, her face
flushing, took the plate, her lips framing a reply which was never
uttered. The shout of laughter that greeted Stacy’s act and words left
Emma without speech. Nor did she speak more than once during the meal,
then only to ask for another cup of coffee.</p>

<p>Breakfast finished and the morning work done in camp, the three men went
out to groom the horses, while Grace and Elfreda strayed away. Their
objective was the rock from which Ham White had made his early
observation.</p>

<p>“Have you the diary?” asked Grace as they seated themselves. “Oh, what a
wonderful view. Isn’t it superb?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have the diary, and I see the view, and agree with you that it
is superb, but suppose we get down to business before we are
interrupted. I do not believe we shall be spied on here, at least,” said
Elfreda, glancing about her.</p>

<p>The thumb-worn book was produced, and the girls bent over it, beginning
with the first page. There were daily weather comments, movements of the
prospector from place to place, little incidents in his daily life, none
of which seemed to shed any light on the subject in which the two girls
were interested.</p>

<p>“Here is something!” breathed Grace finally, and read, under date of
April 30, the following paragraph:</p>

<p>“‘Plenty here. Dare not dig, for am watched. Picked up in channel enough
pay-dirt to keep over next winter. Channel itself ought to pan out
fortune, but shall have to have help. Isn’t safe to try it alone. The
gang of cutthroats would murder me. Some day mebby they’ll get me as it
is.’”</p>

<p>“Hm-m-m-m,” murmured Miss Briggs. “I wondered why, if he had made such a
find, Mr. Petersen shouldn’t get out the gold and put it in a safe place
before someone got ahead of him. The diary seems to furnish a reason for
his delay. He must refer to the Murray gang.”</p>

<p>“Listen to this entry, Elfreda,” begged Grace, reading:</p>

<p>“‘Queer thing this morning. The sun was shining on the children, and on
grandma’s bonnet, but her face was as black as a nigger’s. I wonder if
that was a warning to me to keep away. Gold, gold! How terrible is the
lure for the yellow stuff. It gets into the blood, it eats into the
heart. It’s a frightful disease.’”</p>

<p>“That checks up with what Mr. Petersen had me to write down, doesn’t it,
Grace?” breathed Elfreda.</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly. He must refer to the same thing, but it doesn’t give us
the least idea where the place is.”</p>

<p>“The man would be a fool to write a thing like that in a diary—to tell
where and how. Anything else? There is something on the next page.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Grace, turning the page and reading:</p>

<p>“‘Though I haven’t found it, I know pretty well where the mother lode
is, but I’m afraid of it—afraid to look for it. I’m afraid the wealth I
should find there would kill me just because of the responsibility of
possessing it. Then again, what is there left in life after a man has
got all he has dreamed of, and yearned for, and fought for, and worked
for, up to that time? Nothing!’”</p>

<p>“What a philosopher!” marvelled Grace Harlowe.</p>

<p>“He is right, too,” agreed Miss Briggs. “Suppose we forget about it,
also,” urged Elfreda. “I am tired of it.”</p>

<p>“J. Elfreda, if I didn’t know you so well, I should believe you are in
love, you are so gloomy. Listen! Mr. Petersen probably has no one
surviving him. He wished you to have what he had found. It was the
request of a man about to pass out; it was a trust, Elfreda. One day
someone, perhaps the very ones who tried to kill him, will stumble on
the Lost Mine. I should say that the prospector’s request imposed a duty
on you, my dear—a duty to go to the place he names, take possession of
what you may find there and keep it for your own. You can’t expect to
make a fortune practicing law, especially if you don’t do more
practicing than you have done in the last few years. I fear these summer
outings of ours have cost each of us something.”</p>

<p>Elfreda said she didn’t regret the loss of time. Her time was her own,
and she had sufficient funds to enable her to take care of herself and
the little daughter that she had adopted a few years before.</p>

<p>“The question is, though, how am I going to find this place—how are we
going to find it, I mean, for what I find is for the outfit, not for my
own selfish self. I—”</p>

<p>Elfreda’s eyes had been wandering over the scene that lay before them as
Grace slowly turned the leaves of the diary. Miss Briggs thought she had
seen a movement off to the right at the edge of the rock farthest from
the camp.</p>

<p>“What is it?” demanded Grace, glancing up quickly.</p>

<p>“Nothing. Go on. Find anything else?”</p>

<p>“Only this: ‘When the sun is at the meridian the sands turn to golden
yellow,’” read Grace.</p>

<p>“What does he mean, do you think?”</p>

<p>“I suppose he means to convey that the bed of the dry stream, if it is
dry, shows a sort of golden strip. That is all I can make of it. There
seems to be nothing else in the book in reference to the subject in
which we are particularly interested. I am certain that the poor man
knew what he was saying; I believe that he believed he had found what he
says he found. Whether he did find it or not is quite another matter. In
any event Lost River and the lost mine are well worth looking for as we
go along. If there be such a place, Overland luck will lead us to it,”
finished Grace.</p>

<p>“I doubt it—I was going to say I hope Overland luck doesn’t lead us to
it, to our River of Doubt. Oh, Grace!”</p>

<p>“Wha—at is it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, look!”</p>

<p>A black head of hair, lifted just above the level of the rock on the far
side, revealed a low forehead and a pair of burning black eyes—evil eyes
they seemed to the two startled girls. They could not see the hands that
were gripping the edge of the rock, but what they could see was
sufficient to fill them with alarm.</p>

<p>Without an instant’s hesitation, Elfreda Briggs snatched up a chunk of
flinty rock and hurled it with all her might. The chunk of rock fell a
couple of yards short of the mark, bounced up into the air, and landed
fairly on the man’s head.</p>

<p>“Who says a woman can’t throw a stone!” cried J. Elfreda Briggs almost
hysterically.</p>

</h2>

<p>“Run!” cried Grace.</p>

<p>“The diary!” exclaimed Elfreda, as Grace dropped the book, snatched it
up, and ran clambering down the rocks.</p>

<p>The guide saw them coming, saw that something was wrong, and strode
forward to meet the two girls.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he asked sharply.</p>

<p>“A prowler,” answered Grace, out of breath.</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“There! On the other side of the rock. He was spying on us, and I think
Miss Briggs hit him with a piece of rock,” exclaimed Grace.</p>

<p>“Lieutenant!” called Hamilton White, and sprinted around the base of the
big rock. Hippy Wingate was not far behind him, though Hippy did not
know what had occurred, nor did he wait for an explanation. He knew that
there was trouble, and that was sufficient for him.</p>

<p>The two men reached their objective at about the same time. White was
peering at the rocks and bushes at the base of the big rock.</p>

<p>“Miss Briggs did hit him. See the blood there, and the bushes crushed
where he fell. She must have given him a good wallop,” he chuckled.</p>

<p>White began to run the trail, a trail that was plain and easily
followed. Hippy was right behind him, using his eyes to good advantage.</p>

<p>“Lieutenant, I think you had best go back and watch the camp. This may
be a trick to coax us men away. Keep a sharp lookout. Have Brown stand
guard with you. There is little need to worry, for we can see and hear.
Skip!” urged the guide.</p>

<p>Hippy lost no time in getting back to camp, and when he reached there he
found Grace and Elfreda laughing, and explaining to their companions
what had happened.</p>

<p>They repeated the story to him.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, let them fuss. They can’t do anything to us,” averred
Lieutenant Wingate after he had heard all of the story. “I’ll sit on top
of the rock and watch over you children.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I say,” agreed Stacy. “We men can beat them at their own
game, and have a lap or so to spare. Ham will chase them so far away
that they never will find their way back. If he doesn’t I will.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be too positive,” admonished Grace. “I think it wise for us to be
on the alert. For some reason those ruffians are determined to be rid of
us, at least.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope Hamilton will take care of himself,” murmured Emma, whereat
her companions laughed heartily.</p>

<p>None of the girls left the immediate camp all that morning; they even
sent Stacy to the spring for water, much to that young man’s disgust,
for Stacy had planned on having a fine day’s sleep in his tent.</p>

<p>Noon came, and the guide had not returned, so Grace decided that they
would have something to eat. The girls got the meal.</p>

<p>After they sat down to eat, the girls tried to be merry, but they
admitted that they missed Hamilton White, though none felt alarm at his
absence. The meal finished, dishes were washed and put away, and packs
laid out for a quick move, in the event of that becoming necessary, for
by this time the Overland Riders had learned to be ready at a moment’s
notice.</p>

<p>Hippy from his point of vantage kept guard over the camp and its
vicinity, now and then studying the view spread out before him. The air
was fragrant with the odor of the forest, and Hippy grew sleepy. To keep
awake he decided to get down and walk. This he did, reaching the ground
on the side of the rock farthest from the camp.</p>

<p>The Overlander, with only a revolver, strolled through the forest making
a circle around the camp, and studying the trees for blazes and the
ground for indications of recent visitors. Now and then he would sit
down, back against a tree, and gaze up into the blue sky and the waving
tops of the big pines.</p>

<p>The afternoon wore away and Hippy was still trail-hunting. It was near
supper time when Nora called him. There was no answer, so she climbed
the rock, expecting to find her husband sleeping, for Hippy loved sleep
fully as much as Stacy Brown did.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Wingate was not on the rock, but Nora found his rifle laying
there. She ran back to her companions in alarm.</p>

<p>“Hippy isn’t there!” she cried. “Oh, girls, can anything have happened
to him?” Nora was on the verge of tears.</p>

<p>“No, of course not,” comforted Grace.</p>

<p>“Then where is he?”</p>

<p>“Probably asleep somewhere about,” suggested Emma. “You know he and
Stacy have the sleep habit.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it. I am going out to search for him.”</p>

<p>“Nora, you will not!” differed Grace with emphasis. “We will all remain
where we are. To get separated would be foolish. Hippy is all right, so
sit down and chat with us. Mr. White will be along soon, and some others
besides Emma Dean will be glad to see him,” she added, with a teasing
glance at Emma.</p>

<p>The Overland girls ate a cold supper that night, no one feeling like
cooking or sitting down to a hearty meal. Nora was so worried that she
refused to eat at all, and, while the other girls were equally
disturbed, they masked their real feelings by teasing each other. Emma
and Stacy were ragged unmercifully.</p>

<p>Darkness settled over the forest, but still no Hippy, no guide.</p>

<p>“I think it will be advisable to bring in the horses, don’t you,
Elfreda?” asked Grace.</p>

<p>Miss Briggs and the others thought that would be a wise move, so the
ponies, and such of their equipment as was outside the camp, were
brought in; fuel was gathered and piled up so that they might keep the
fire burning; then the party sat down in their tents, with blankets
thrown over their shoulders, and began their watch.</p>

<p>It was ten o’clock that night when the hail of Ham White was heard, and
after the tension of the last few hours the Overland girls felt like
screaming a welcome. Instead they sprang out and stood awaiting him.</p>

<p>“Well, did you good people think I had deserted you?” he cried out. “I
am nearly famished. Is there anything left from dinner?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course there is. I will get you something. First I must tell
you. Mr. Wingate has been missing since some time this afternoon. We
don’t know what to make of it unless he has fallen asleep somewhere,”
said Grace.</p>

<p>“What! Tell me about it.”</p>

<p>Nora told the guide the story, explaining that Hippy had taken up his
station on the rock to guard the camp, and that that was the last they
saw of him.</p>

<p>Ham White was disturbed, but he did not show it. Instead he laughed.</p>

<p>“No doubt, as Mrs. Gray has suggested, he has gone to sleep. Where is
Mr. Brown?”</p>

<p>“He is asleep in his tent, as usual,” spoke up Emma. “Oh, Hamilton,
won’t you please find Hippy—now?”</p>

<p>“I will do my best. Give me a snack and I’ll go out now. I followed the
other trail for something like five miles. There were four men in the
party, only one of whom came near the camp. The trail finally bumped
into the side of a mountain and I lost it. It was so dark I could not
follow it farther. Thank you!” he added, as Emma handed him some bacon.
“I will go right out.”</p>

<p>They followed him around the rock and watched with keen interest as Ham
White searched for and found the trail of the missing Hippy, which he
followed, with the aid of his pocket lamp, for some distance.</p>

<p>“He was strolling,” announced the guide. “You can see here where he sat
down to rest, then went on. Please return to camp. Unless he wandered
off and lost his way, I shall probably soon find him.”</p>

<p>The girls promptly turned back towards camp, Nora with reluctance, which
she made no effort to conceal. Then followed two hours of anxiety. The
guide returned shortly after midnight.</p>

<p>“There is no use of searching farther to-night,” he announced. “Mr.
Wingate undoubtedly has strayed away, but I’ll find him in the morning.
Please turn in and get some rest, for we shall undoubtedly have an
active day to-morrow. In any event, don’t lose your nerve, Mrs. Wingate.
The Lieutenant has had enough experience to know how to take care of
himself.”</p>

<p>Nora went to her tent weeping, Emma Dean’s arm around her, but Grace
held back at a gesture from Elfreda, who had observed that the guide
studiously avoided looking directly at Nora Wingate.</p>

<p>“Mr. White, have you anything to say to us?” questioned Elfreda.</p>

<p>“Meaning what?”</p>

<p>“We wish to know what you really did discover. It was well not to say
any more than you did to Mrs. Wingate.”</p>

<p>“You made a discovery of some sort—of that we are convinced,” spoke up
Grace.</p>

<p>“Yes, I did,” admitted White. “I found the lieutenant’s revolver beside
a tree where he had been sitting. His trail ended there!”</p>

<p>“Meaning?” persisted Miss Briggs.</p>

<p>“That he was attacked and carried away, in all probability. I found
evidences of that.”</p>

<p>“What can be done?” demanded Elfreda.</p>

<p>“Nothing until morning. I have means of obtaining assistance, which I
will employ as soon as it is light enough to see.”</p>

<p>The girls turned away and walked slowly to their tent, and the guide
stepped over to the tent occupied by Hippy and Stacy Brown. He was out
in a moment and striding towards Elfreda’s quarters.</p>

<p>“Miss Briggs! Mrs. Gray!” he called.</p>

<p>“Yes!” answered the voices of Elfreda and Grace.</p>

<p>“Stacy Brown is not in his tent. There has been a struggle, and the boy
has been forcibly removed,” was the startling announcement.</p>

</h2>

<p>“Sta—Stacy gone?” exclaimed Elfreda Briggs. “It can’t be possible. He is
playing one of his practical jokes on us.”</p>

<p>“Let us look, but don’t disturb Emma and Nora if it can be avoided,”
urged Grace.</p>

<p>The two girls, with the guide, repaired to Lieutenant Wingate’s tent,
and examined it, using their pocket lamps. It was as Hamilton White had
said—there was every evidence that a struggle had taken place there. The
fat boy’s hat and his revolver lay where they had been hurled to one
side of the tent. His blouse was a yard or so to the rear, and the
imprint of his heels where they had been dragged over the ground was
plainly visible.</p>

<p>“He must have been asleep,” nodded White.</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Grace. “If awake Stacy would have set up such a howl that
none could have failed to hear. When do you think this was done, Mr.
White?”</p>

<p>“When we were out looking for the lieutenant. If you will remember, Mr.
Brown remained behind.”</p>

<p>“Do you think it wise to follow his trail?” asked Grace.</p>

<p>“No. Not now. I dare not leave the camp. All this may be part of a plan.
My duty is here, at least until daylight, when I will get into
communication with those who will find both men.”</p>

<p>“You think so, Mr. White?” questioned Elfreda anxiously.</p>

<p>“Yes. It is the work of the same gang, but what their motive is we can
only surmise. You and Mrs. Gray may know.”</p>

<p>Elfreda felt her face growing hot, and a retort was on her lips, but she
suppressed it.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Gray, if you think I should try to run the trail now, I will do
so, but it would be against my judgment. I hope you do not insist,” said
White, turning to Grace.</p>

<p>“I believe you are right,” answered Grace. “Come, Elfreda, we will go to
our tent, for no serious harm can come either to Hippy or Stacy. They
dare not harm them.”</p>

<p>Ham White did not reply. He knew the character of the men who committed
that piece of banditry, and knew that they would hesitate at no crime to
gain their ends, whatever those ends might be.</p>

<p>The guide got no sleep that night. Mindful of the attacks that had been
made on the camp, he took up his position at a distance, and, with rifle
in hand, sat motionless the rest of the night. From his position in the
deep shadows he commanded a view of the entire camp, which was dimly
lighted by the campfire all night long.</p>

<p>There were occasional sounds that Ham White did not believe were made by
marauding animals, but none were definite enough to warrant exposing his
position. During his vigil nothing occurred to disturb the sleepers.</p>

<p>The graying mists of the early morning were rising from gulch and
forest, enfolding the mountaintops, when Ham White stole around the
camp, scrutinizing every foot of the ground. By the time he had
completed this task the mists were so far cleared away that a good view
of the surrounding country might be had.</p>

<p>From his kit the guide selected a wigwag signalling flag, and taking one
of the tent poles for use as a flagstaff, he went cautiously to the high
rock that stood sentinel over the Overland camp, and climbed to its top.</p>

<p>“I hope none of the girls wake up,” he muttered, peering down into the
camp, which was as quiet as a deserted forest.</p>

<p>Ham White, after attaching the flag to the pole, began waving it up and
down, which in the wigwag code means, “I wish to speak with you.”</p>

<p>It was at this juncture that Grace Harlowe slowly opened her eyes. Where
she lay she could look straight up to the top of the rock without making
the slightest movement, and her amazement must have been reflected in
her eyes.</p>

<p>Like several of the Overland girls, Grace’s experience in the war had
included learning to signal and to read signals. She was out of
practice, but was easily able to read any message not sent too fast. Ham
began his message, after getting the attention of the persons to whom he
was signalling, at a speed that Grace could not follow. She did,
however, catch a few words that were enlightening.</p>

<p>“Trouble—Haley—Trail—Send word—Caution—Great secrecy or expose
hands—Fatal to—” were some of the words that she caught as the guide
flashed them off. Then he paused.</p>

<p>“How I wish I could see the answer,” muttered the Overland girl, as she
watched Hamilton White, with glasses at his eyes, receiving the message
that was being sent to him.</p>

<p>Grace Harlowe’s, however, were not the only pair of eyes that witnessed
that exhibition of signalling. Other eyes were observing, but that other
pair could not read a word of what the signallers were saying.</p>

<p>White dropped his glasses and snatched up his flag, and she read, this
time with greater ease:</p>

<p>“It may be fatal. Great danger to both. My responsibility. Must have
instant action. This an order. Obey without loss time. Report soon as
anything to say.” The guide signed his name, and the words that followed
the signature filled Grace Harlowe with amazement. She saw the guide
remove the flag from its staff and hide it under a stone, after which he
descended to the camp, passing the open tents without so much as a
glance at them.</p>

<p>Ham stirred up the fire and put over the breakfast, and, while it was
cooking, Grace came out, greeting him cheerfully.</p>

<p>“Is there any news, Mr. White?” she asked sweetly.</p>

<p>“No, not yet.”</p>

<p>“What have you done?”</p>

<p>“I signalled to a fire-lookout station that assistance was needed. It is
best to wait until we hear from them.”</p>

<p>“How, signal?” she questioned, appearing not to understand.</p>

<p>“By the air route, Mrs. Gray,” was the smiling reply.</p>

<p>Grace Harlowe shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>“You are a very clever man, Mr. White,” she said, and walked to her tent
to awaken Miss Briggs.</p>

<p>When informed that Stacy Brown was missing, a few moments later, Nora
Wingate became hysterical, but Grace and Elfreda calmed her, and the
party were ready to sit down to breakfast when the guide announced it as
ready.</p>

<p>It was a trying, anxious morning for the little band of Overlanders.
White made frequent trips to the rock, observed questioningly by
Elfreda.</p>

<p>“What is he looking for, Grace?” she asked. “Does the man expect to find
the bandits that way?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Why not ask him, J. Elfreda?”</p>

<p>“Not I. You know I would not.”</p>

<p>About mid-forenoon Grace suggested to the guide that he go out into the
forest and see if he could glean any information as to the direction
that the kidnappers had taken when they left the camp, with either Hippy
or Stacy Brown.</p>

<p>White pondered the subject a moment, then agreed.</p>

<p>“If you will promise not to leave camp, and to fire a shot at the least
suspicious sound or occurrence, I will go out,” he said. “One of you had
better go to the rock and take station there until my return.”</p>

<p>Grace said she would do that. Matters were working out to her
satisfaction, and, after telling Elfreda to take her rifle and post
herself a short distance to the rear of the camp, and assigning Emma and
Nora to the right and left ends of their camping place, Grace climbed
the rock and sat down. After Ham White, following a survey of the camp
and her arrangements, of which he approved with a nod and a wave of the
hand, had left the camp, Grace got up and looked for the signal flag,
which she found under a flat stone.</p>

<p>“Now! Having disposed of my companions I shall see what I shall and can
see,” she told herself.</p>

<p>Securing the signal flag, the Overland girl took a survey of the
landscape. A vast sea of dense forest lay all about her, broken here and
there by a white-capped mountain. Nothing that looked as if it might be
a fire-lookout station attracted her eyes. She had used her field
glasses, but without result.</p>

<p>A moment of vigorous signalling on her part followed, after which Grace
swept the landscape again. She discovered nothing at all. Another trial
was made, and the word “answer” was spelled out by her.</p>

<p>Her eye caught a faint something far to the north of her, and Grace’s
glasses were at her eyes in a twinkling. A little white flag was
fluttering up and down against the background of forest green in the far
distance.</p>

<p>“I’ve got him!” cried the girl exultingly. “I’ve got him!” Then,
wigwagging, Grace Harlowe signalled the one word, “Report!”</p>

<p>“Who?” came the answer, almost before she could get the glasses to her
eyes to read the message.</p>

<p>“For White,” she wigwagged. “Report!”</p>

<p>Holding the flag, now lowered to the rock, with one hand, the other
holding the glasses to her eyes, Grace bent every faculty to watching
that little fluttering, bobbing square of white, that, at her distance
from it, looked little larger than a postage stamp.</p>

<p>“Repeat!” she interrupted frequently, whenever part of a word was
missed. It was a laborious effort for her, out of practice as she was,
and the exchange of messages lasted for a full half hour before the
Overland girl gave her unseen, unknown signaller the “O. K.” signal.</p>

<p>Grace folded the flag and placed it under the stone, then straightened
up.</p>

<p>“Mr. Hamilton White, I have you now!” she exclaimed, a triumphant note
in her voice.</p>

</h2>

<p>“Where am I at?”</p>

<p>It was Hippy Wingate’s first conscious moment since he was struck down
while sleeping with his back against a tree not far from the Overland
camp. All was darkness about him as he awakened in unfamiliar
surroundings. Essaying to rise, the Overlander discovered that he was
bound. Still worse, there was a gag in his mouth.</p>

<p>A gentle breeze was blowing over him, and at first he thought he was
still under the trees. Hippy then realized that there was a hard floor
beneath him. His head ached, and when he tried to sit up he found that
it swam dizzily.</p>

<p>“I wonder what happened to me?” he muttered. “Hello!”</p>

<p>There was no response to his call; in fact, his voice, still weak, did
not carry far and it was thick because of the gag. Then began a struggle
with himself, that, while it exhausted him for the time being, aided in
overcoming his dizziness.</p>

<p>Hippy heard men conversing, heard them approaching, whereupon he
pretended still to be unconscious. A door was flung wide open, and a
lantern, held high, lighted up the interior of the building with a faint
radiance.</p>

<p>“Hain’t woke up,” announced one of the two men who stood in the doorway.</p>

<p>“Mebby he never will,” answered the other.</p>

<p>“I don’t reckon it makes much difference, so long as we got two of ’em,”
returned the first speaker. “What shall we do—let ’im sleep?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>The man with the lantern strode over and peered down at the prostrate
Overlander, while the prisoner, from beneath what seemed to be closed
eyelids, got a good look into the swarthy, hard-lined face. Lieutenant
Wingate would remember that face—he would remember the voices of both
men—would know them wherever he heard them.</p>

<p>“Let ’im sleep. When he wakes up we’ll have something to say to ’im.”
With that the two men went out, slamming the door behind them.</p>

<p>The lantern light had shown Hippy that he was in a log cabin. At his
back was a window, or a window-opening, for which he was thankful, as it
offered a possible way of escape. But how, in his present condition,
could he hope to gain his liberty?</p>

<p>There was no answer to the Overlander’s mental question. First, he must
regain his strength. The leather thongs with which he was bound
interfered with his circulation, and his legs were numb. So were his
arms, and his jaws ached from the gag that was between his teeth. In
fact, Lieutenant Hippy Wingate did not remember ever to have suffered so
many aches and pains at one time as he had at that moment.</p>

<p>He began his struggles again, but more with the idea of starting his
circulation and gaining strength than with any immediate hope of escape.
By rolling over several times he was able to reach the door, but having
reached it he had no hands with which to open it. Hippy wanted to look
out. Failing there, he bethought himself of the window, and rolled back
across the floor to it. Exerting a great effort, he managed to work his
head up to the window so he could see out.</p>

<p>The night was dark, but the Overlander was able to make out trees and
rugged rocky walls, together with what appeared to be a dense mass of
bushes. The scene was unlike anything he had seen in the State of
Washington since his party had started on their outing.</p>

<p>“I may be up in the Canadian Rockies, for all I know,” he muttered.</p>

<p>Hippy sank down, weak and trembling.</p>

<p>For a change, he rolled back and forth, pulling himself up to the window
again and again, and each time found himself stronger than before.</p>

<p>“If I were free and had a gun I’d show those cowards something!” raged
the Overlander, his anger rising. “Why did they have to pick on me? I
wonder what the folks at the camp are think—”</p>

<p>“Sh-h-h-h!”</p>

<p>It was a low, sibilant hiss from the window, and Hippy fell suddenly
silent.</p>

<p>“Keep quiet and listen to me,” warned a hoarse voice. “The gang is out
of range, but we don’t know when one or more of ’em will be back. I’m
coming in.”</p>

<p>Not being able to answer, except with a grunt, the Overlander merely
grunted his understanding.</p>

<p>The stranger leaped into the room and felt for the prisoner.</p>

<p>“I am going to cut you loose. Are you wounded?”</p>

<p>“No, I think not,” mumbled Hippy, but his words were unintelligible.</p>

<p>The first thing the stranger did was to remove the gag, which he did
with so much care that the operation gave no pain. Then came the leather
thongs. These he ripped off with a few deft sweeps of a knife, and
Lieutenant Wingate was a free man so far as his bonds were concerned.</p>

<p>“Can you walk?” in the same hoarse voice.</p>

<p>“I could fly if I had to,” was the brief reply. “Who are you?”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t know if I told you. Here!” The man thrust a revolver into
his hand. “Don’t use it unless you have to. We aren’t out of the woods
by a long shot. Come!”</p>

<p>The stranger assisted Hippy through the window, which was accomplished
with some difficulty, for Lieutenant Wingate was stiff and sore. A firm
hand was fixed on his arm, and his companion began leading him rapidly
away. Not a word was spoken for several minutes—not until they had
plunged into the dark depths of a canyon, through which the man picked
the way unerringly.</p>

<p>“How are you standing it?” was the question abruptly put to Lieutenant
Wingate.</p>

<p>“Rotten! But I’ll pick up speed as I go along and get my motors warmed
up.”</p>

<p>The stranger chuckled.</p>

<p>“Where are we going?”</p>

<p>“We are headed for your camp, but it’s quite a hike and a hard one. If
you get leg-weary, stop and rest a bit. How’d they get you?”</p>

<p>“I went to sleep just outside the camp, and I think I must have got a
clump on the head. Ouch!” Hippy had lifted a hand to his head, and felt
there a bump as big as an egg. “I guess I did get a clump. It’s a wonder
I’m not dead. When is it, to-day or to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“It’s the day after,” was the half humorous reply.</p>

<p>“Please tell me how you found me?” asked the Overlander.</p>

<p>“Ham White got in touch with some people I know. They got word to me,
and gave me the tip. The same people saw the gang that got you heading
for the pass where you were taken, so I made for that place as soon as I
got the word from White. I was lucky; I might have had to hunt the whole
state over for you. The gang made a bad play when they picked you up.
We’ve got a line on them now.”</p>

<p>“Who is we?” interjected Hippy.</p>

<p>“All of us,” was the noncommittal reply. “Don’t speak so loudly. It
isn’t safe yet.”</p>

<p>That walk Hippy Wingate never forgot. Every step sent shooting pains
through his head and legs. He stumbled frequently, but every time the
grip of the stranger tightened on his arm, and he was kept on his feet.</p>

<p>“When you get to camp, tell your people to watch out. Some of the gang
are still out on trail. I reckon they aren’t out for any good, and they
may be planning to rush your camp and get the rest of your party.”</p>

<p>“Why do they want us?” wondered Lieutenant Wingate. “Is it robbery?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but not the sort of robbery you think. Tell your friend Miss
Briggs that it’s time she told her party her story. She knows why.”</p>

<p>“I begin to see a light,” muttered the Overlander. “Say! There’s
something familiar about your voice, but I can’t place it. Got a cold?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Little conversation was indulged in after that, and at last Hippy’s
rescuer halted and pointed.</p>

<p>“See that light?” he asked in a whisper.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“That’s your camp. I leave you here. Take my advice, and don’t make much
noise to-night. Keep your fire low, and post guards. Tell White there is
a man out here wants to see him. You need not let the others know about
my being here. I’m in a hurry. Good-night.”</p>

<p>“But—won’t you come—”</p>

<p>“Go on!”</p>

<p>Hippy wavered a little as he started towards the camp, into which he
staggered a few minutes later.</p>

<p>A cry greeted his appearance, and Nora’s arms were flung about his neck
ere he had fairly reached the light of the campfire. He held up his hand
for silence.</p>

<p>“Give me something to eat, if you love me. I’m famished.”</p>

<p>Nora ran for the coffee pot, which Ham White took from her. Hippy
stepped over to him and whispered something to the guide, as he relieved
White of the coffee pot.</p>

<p>White immediately left the camp.</p>

<p>By now the other members of the party were about Hippy shoving their joy
at his return.</p>

<p>“Have you seen Stacy?” demanded Grace eagerly, as soon as she could get
his attention.</p>

<p>“No. Why?”</p>

<p>“He, too, has been missing, and—”</p>

<p>“The curs!” raged Lieutenant Wingate. “So they got him, too, did they?”</p>

<p>“Never mind now. You must drink and eat. Where is Mr. White?” wondered
Grace, glancing quickly about the camp.</p>

<p>“I sent him out on an errand,” answered Hippy. “Ah! The coffee is not so
hot that it burns, but it’s nectar.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my darlin’! Your head!” cried Nora, just discovering the swelling
there.</p>

<p>Elfreda was at his side in an instant, examining the lump that, to
Hippy, seemed fully as big as his head itself. Miss Briggs ran to her
tent for liniment, and in a moment was applying it to the sore spot.</p>

<p>Hippy’s story was brief, because there was little that he could tell
them. He was amazed when he learned that he had been away so long.</p>

<p>Grace explained to him how White had reached some lookouts on the range
and got them to go in search of him. “How they found you so soon, I
don’t understand. Do you?”</p>

<p>Hippy shook his head.</p>

<p>“There are some things in this neck of the woods that are beyond
explaining. I hope they didn’t give Stacy such a wallop as I got. But
don’t worry about him. They can’t keep him long. Stacy will eat them out
of his way. I was easy. He isn’t.”</p>

<p>Ham White returned at this juncture.</p>

<p>“We shall probably have another guest to-night, if all goes well,” he
announced.</p>

<p>“A guest?” wondered the Overlanders.</p>

<p>“So I am informed; perhaps more than one. Do not ask any questions, for
I can’t answer them. Well, Lieutenant, you had a rough time of it,
didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“The Germans could not have done anything much worse.”</p>

<p>“Would you recognize any of the fellows who captured you?” questioned
White.</p>

<p>“I saw only two, but I shall know them when I see them, and they will
have reason to know me, for—”</p>

<p>“Hamilton, who are the guests you are expecting?” urged Emma in her
sweetest tone of voice.</p>

<p>“Sorry, Miss Dean, but I can’t tell you.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that just like a man—making a mystery of everything? I think—”</p>

<p>“Hello, folks!” cried a voice from the bush.</p>

<p>The Overlanders fairly jumped at the sound of the familiar voice.</p>

<p>“Tom! Tom Gray!” cried Grace, running and throwing herself into her
husband’s arms. “How happy I am to see you, you will never know. I
needed you, Tom—we all have needed you, and I think we shall need you
still more. Where did you come from?”</p>

<p>“Hello, old chap!” cried Hippy jovially.</p>

<p>The Overlanders crowded around Captain Tom Gray joyously.</p>

<p>“How are you, White!” greeted Grace’s husband, as soon as he could free
himself from the welcome of Grace, Nora and Emma. “I have been looking
forward to meeting you, and I knew, from what I had heard, just the sort
of man you would be—I mean as to looks,” added Tom, grinning. “The men
on the range are looking forward to seeing their—”</p>

<p>A warning look from the guide checked Tom.</p>

<p>“I will explain later,” whispered the guide.</p>

<p>“I thank you for sending for me,” bowed Tom, with ready resourcefulness.
“I knew that the need must be urgent or you would not have done so.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I have a double responsibility—a moral and a physical one, and I
felt that I had no right to go farther until I had consulted with Mrs.
Gray’s husband. We are heading for trouble, in fact we have already been
having it.”</p>

<p>“Tell me about it. I know some of the facts, but I want them at first
hand.”</p>

<p>“Miss Briggs knows the story. I suggest that she relate the story of her
experiences, which will give you the slant I want you to get. I suppose
you know of the kidnapping of Lieutenant Wingate and Stacy Brown?” asked
the guide.</p>

<p>“The bare facts only. J. Elfreda, you seem to be the pivotal point on
this journey. Grace is holding my hand so tightly that I shall have to
ask her to give me a chance to listen to you,” answered Tom laughingly.</p>

<p>Emma offered to demonstrate to give Tom a “chance” to hear the story.
Grace laughed happily. A great load of responsibility and worry had been
lifted from her shoulders.</p>

<p>“I will be good, J. Elfreda. Please tell Tom everything—everything,
remember. Mr. White, we wish you to sit in,” added Grace, as the guide
discreetly moved away.</p>

<p>There followed a moment of silence, then Elfreda Briggs began the story
of the fire, of her arrival at the forest cabin, and of the dramatic
occurrences there. She told of the diary, of the loss of the gold dust,
and of the general directions that Sam Petersen had left for locating
the claim, though Elfreda did not say what those directions were. She
thought it advisable not to do so.</p>

<p>Hippy got up and walked to his tent, returning shortly and standing with
his back to a tree and his hands in his pockets as Miss Briggs finished
her story.</p>

<p>Grace took up the story from that point, relating all that had occurred
since Elfreda’s experience in the forest shack, but avoiding what she
had learned through her wigwagging about Hamilton White.</p>

<p>Tom Gray pondered over the story, stroking his cheek, which Tom always
did when thinking deeply.</p>

<p>“The Murrays, eh, White?” he questioned, glancing up at the guide.</p>

<p>Ham White nodded.</p>

<p>“It looks that way,” replied White.</p>

<p>“They know about this Lost River story, do you think?”</p>

<p>“Most everyone does up here. It is an old Indian legend, and probably
has no more foundation in fact than most Indian legends,” answered the
guide. “Mind you, I am not saying that such a place doesn’t exist. No
doubt there are many rich veins in the Cascade Range yet to be
discovered. Petersen evidently believed he had found it, but he
undoubtedly was delirious when he described the spot. He had been shot,
you know.”</p>

<p>“When he made the entries in his diary he hadn’t been shot,” retorted
Miss Briggs with some warmth. She checked herself sharply.</p>

<p>“Not having seen the entries I cannot say,” replied White.</p>

<p>“What puzzles me is what became of the contents of the bag of gold.
Surely the bandit who came back did not take it, for he did not have the
opportunity,” reminded Captain Gray. “What became of it, Elfreda?”</p>

<p>“Have a look at this,” spoke up Hippy Wingate, tossing a small leather
pouch of his own into Elfreda’s lap.</p>

<p>“Wha—what—” gasped the girl.</p>

<p>“It is the gold you thought had been stolen, and—”</p>

<p>A peculiar whirring sound checked what Hippy was about to say. The
Overlanders glanced up and saw descending upon them what they took to be
a falling firebrand, with a streamer of light like the tail of a comet
following it.</p>

<p>“Look out!” shouted Hippy.</p>

<p>His warning was not necessary, for the Overland Riders had leaped to
their feet and ran for cover. The firebrand hit the ground with a thud,
and as it landed Hamilton White threw a blanket on it, and himself on
the blanket to smother the flame. The guide knew that there was a
meaning in that flaming visitor’s arrival, and he wished to ascertain
it.</p>

<p>“Oh, Hamilton, what is it?” cried Emma.</p>

<p>“The flaming arrow!” exclaimed Tom Gray. “That’s an Indian trick. No
white man ever thought of that. What does it mean, White?”</p>

<p>“Wait!” The guide removed a thin piece of bark that had been bound to
the arrow near its butt, and from under the bark he drew out a piece of
paper. “It is a message,” he announced after peering at the piece of
paper, and then handed it to Tom Gray.</p>

</h2>

<p>“It’s a red hot one, I’ll bet!” exclaimed Hippy.</p>

<p>“Hippy!” admonished Nora.</p>

<p>“What is it, Tom?” begged Grace, slipping an arm through his. “I think I
know.”</p>

<p>“You are right, Hippy.” Captain Gray held the slip of paper down so the
feeble light of the fire shone upon it. “It is from Stacy. Listen:</p>

<p>“‘Help! I’m in Dutch again. Get me out, quick. They are a lot of ruf—of
fine gentlemen here, but they want something that you’ve got. If they
don’t get it I’m to be shot at sunrise. Oh, wow! They want a book they
say you have, and they want it bad. You are to leave it on top of the
rock by the camp and go away. They want something else, too—a bag of
gold that you or somebody took from that fellow Petersen. Mebby I’ll see
him soon. Do you folks know anything about the gold? I told them the
nearest thing to gold that I’d seen up here was a sunset the other
night. They say the book and the gold doesn’t belong to you—that one of
our party stole it. You folks have been holding out on me! I’ll be even
with you for that. Can’t write any more ’cause the mail man won’t wait.
Hurry, for the love of Mike! Hurry or I’m a dead one! Wow! Stacy.’”</p>

<p>“They wouldn’t dare!” cried Nora.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes they would,” answered Tom. “The Murrays are a desperate gang.
Even if they get what they demand they might put him out of the way, but
it is my opinion that they will simply set him adrift, in which event we
shall find him. How do you communicate, White?” he asked, turning to the
guide.</p>

<p>“He wigwags,” spoke up Grace; whereat the guide gave her a quick glance,
but the Overland girl’s face told him nothing.</p>

<p>“Please take your flashlight and see if you can pick up a station with
it, White. If so, tell them where the boy may possibly be and ask them
to send someone after him.”</p>

<p>“Just a moment, Captain. May I speak with you aside?”</p>

<p>Tom stepped away from his companions, and he and the guide held a long
whispered conversation. Tom then returned to the others.</p>

</div>

<p>“Mr. White advises against doing as I suggested. He says the rangers are
already looking for Stacy, and that to signal would simply be putting
the bandits on their guard. There are other reasons which he has given
me in confidence. You shall know all about it later on. Now may I see
that diary, Miss Briggs?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course. Throw it away if you like. I never want to see the
hateful thing again. What I do think I am entitled to, though, is an
explanation from you, Hippy Wingate. When, where and how did you get my
bag of gold?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps a good little fairy, knowing my love for the yellow stuff,
dropped it into my mess kit so that I might buy gold plates to use at
meals in place of the luxurious tin plates that I am now using. How did
you get it, J. Elfreda?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Petersen gave it to me. He said the Murrays knew he had it, and
that it was to be mine for what he was pleased to call my kindness to
him. He gave me the diary at the same time because it held a supposed
clue to Lost Mine and Lost River, a river paved with gold.”</p>

<p>“I don’t wonder that Stacy accuses us of ‘holding out on him,’” chuckled
Tom Gray.</p>

<p>“I might, and with very good reason, make the same accusation against
certain persons unmentionable,” retorted Miss Briggs, which brought a
laugh from her companions.</p>

<p>Tom Gray, in the meantime, had been running over the pages of the diary,
noting every entry made by the old prospector.</p>

<p>“A leaf has been torn out of here. It looks as if it were lately torn
out. Did you do it?” he asked, addressing Miss Briggs.</p>

<p>Grace explained that the leaf was torn out when the book was snatched
from her hand one night, of which circumstance she had already told Tom.</p>

<p>“What was on it?”</p>

<p>“We destroyed the leaf,” spoke up Miss Briggs.</p>

<p>“That wasn’t what I asked you, J. Elfreda. Of course you do not have to
answer if you don’t wish to. I am simply trying to get at the bottom of
this affair as a guide to our immediate actions. It is very important.”</p>

<p>Elfreda glanced at Hamilton White. He caught the glance and, instantly
comprehending, stepped back and began poking the fire and putting on
fresh fuel.</p>

<p>“‘Grandma and the Children—three peaks due east,’” whispered Elfreda.</p>

<p>She saw a sudden flash in Tom Gray’s eyes, an expression that Elfreda
was unable to interpret.</p>

<p>“‘When the sun is at the meridian the sands turn to golden yellow,’” he
quoted from the diary. “This, taken in connection with what you say was
on the torn leaf, is quite enlightening. I think we will tear out two
more pages while we are about it, if you have no objection.”</p>

<p>“Go as far as you like, Tom. You may throw the book away if you wish. It
has brought us only bad luck,” said Miss Briggs.</p>

<p>“I say, White! My suggestion is that we leave this confounded diary
where Stacy directs us to leave it.”</p>

<p>“And the gold?”</p>

<p>“Well, that is different. I don’t like the idea of giving gold to those
cutthroats. What is the value of the stuff? Let us look it over.”</p>

<p>Tom Gray examined the nuggets, weighed them in his hand, a stone at a
time, and, disregarding the “dust,” closed and secured the bag. Then he
opened it, and weighing out several nuggets again in his hand, glanced
over at Miss Briggs.</p>

<p>“I should say that there is something more than two thousand dollars’
worth of nuggets and ‘dirt’ there, of which I hold from five to seven
hundred dollars’ worth in my hand. Elfreda, you probably will think I
have a cold nerve to make the suggestion, but I propose that we put
these nuggets in a bag with the diary and leave them for the bandits.”</p>

<p>“What! Give five hundred dollars to a bunch of bandits?” cried Hippy
aghast. “Impossible! Are you crazy?”</p>

<p>“We may be, at that,” admitted Captain Gray.</p>

<p>“Say yes. Tom knows what he is doing,” whispered Grace, nudging Miss
Briggs.</p>

<p>“Of course, Tom,” replied Elfreda promptly. “If you say leave it all,
I’ll say the same. You can’t imagine what a relief it will be to me to
be rid of it.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. White! A word with you!”</p>

<p>An earnest conversation followed between Tom Gray and the guide,
following which, Ham White packed his kit, stowed some food in his bag
and brought up his horse.</p>

<p>“Look here, old top! Where are you going?” demanded Hippy.</p>

<p>“On business, Lieutenant. The Captain can tell you why. I hope to see
you soon. Good-night and good luck.” With that the guide turned his
horse toward the south, the opposite direction from that which the
Overland Riders were following. They were amazed, and demanded an
explanation.</p>

<p>“It isn’t safe to say a word,” answered Tom. “I’ll tell you this much,
though. Pack up and be ready to start on a long ride within an hour. We
are heading towards home!”</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XX</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>“I’M SHOT!” CRIES EMMA</span>
</h2>

<p>“Home!” cried Nora and Emma in chorus. “No, no, no!”</p>

<p>“Why go home?” wondered Miss Briggs. “I thought we had just started on
our adventures.”</p>

<p>“Don’t oppose,” whispered Grace.</p>

<p>“So that’s the game, is it?” chuckled Hippy, who had been regarding Tom
narrowly, and saw by the expression of Captain Gray’s face that he had a
definite motive in making the announcement that they were about to head
towards home.</p>

<p>“All right, Grace. He did not say that we are going home,” answered Miss
Briggs in reply to Grace. “I might have known. To leave here now, with
Stacy missing, and our affairs in the air, as it were, would be
unthinkable. I am afraid my brain is becoming addled.”</p>

<p>“You should demonstrate,” reminded Emma, and Elfreda nodded her approval
of the sentiment.</p>

<p>Preparations for the departure had already been begun by Captain Gray,
and now Hippy turned in to assist him. Tom soon left to get his horse,
which had been tethered not far from camp. He had refused to answer
questions as to how he found the camp, nor did Grace ask, but the others
did.</p>

<p>When all was in readiness for leaving, packs lashed, horses saddled,
Tom, taking the diary and the gold, went to the rock and hid the stuff
as the message from Stacy had directed them to do.</p>

<p>“Mount!” ordered Tom upon his return from planting the book and the
gold, and he doused the fire, making certain that every last spark was
extinguished. He then swung into his saddle and led the way, heading
south, followed silently by the others of the party. They wondered how,
in the darkness, he could find his way, but Tom was taking the stars as
his guides. He was too experienced a forester not to be able to go in
any direction in a forest, day or night, and go almost unerringly.</p>

<p>The Overlanders were sleepy and not any too happy. They were worrying
about Stacy, too. There was little conversation because it was necessary
to give all attention to their riding. Riding in a forest at night is a
trying experience, and sometimes a painful one when one considers the
bumps, the collisions of legs against trees, and the slaps in the face
from low-hanging bushes. All this the Overland party experienced, so
their progress was slow.</p>

<p>They had proceeded about an hour when a distant rifle report was heard.
It seemed to come from the rear. Tom called a halt to listen. A rattling
fire sprang up, and continued for several minutes; then died out after a
few further scattering shots.</p>

<p>“Can you locate it, Tom?” called Hippy.</p>

<p>“I should say that the firing is somewhere near the camp we left,”
replied Tom.</p>

<p>“Oh, how strange,” cried Emma. “Why are they fighting there, and who is
it that is fighting?”</p>

<p>“Quite possibly it is the bandits fighting over J. Elfreda’s gold,”
suggested Grace as the party, at a command from Tom Gray, moved forward
again. Some time later the leader called back that they were about to
come upon a small watercourse and that they would follow it.</p>

<p>“We shall probably find plenty of overhanging bushes, so protect your
faces,” he directed.</p>

<p>They wondered how he knew that they were near a stream. Tom said he
could smell it.</p>

<p>“Wonderful scent,” growled Hippy. “Perhaps you can tell us whether or
not the water is wet.”</p>

<p>“It may be for you if you don’t watch your step,” answered Captain Gray
laughingly.</p>

<p>They entered the stream a few moments after that, and the going proved
to be even worse than Grace’s husband had predicted. Bushes hung over
the stream and met, forming a bower so low that the riders had to lean
well forward to protect their faces from being continuously whipped. Not
alone that, but the horses were constantly slipping on moss-covered
stones, threatening at every moment to unhorse their riders.</p>

<p>Emma wailed her protests ere they had proceeded far, but Tom said they
must take their medicine and be good sports.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to be a sport,” complained Emma. “I want to sleep.”</p>

<p>“Demonstrate over it,” advised Lieutenant Wingate.</p>

<p>It was just before daylight when Tom headed out of the stream through a
narrow defile in the rocks, finally coming to a halt on a level piece of
ground of about three acres, surrounded on all sides by mountain
forests.</p>

<p>The Overlanders could not see their surroundings clearly, but got a
general idea of them, and immediately begged their leader to let them
dismount for a rest and for a bite to eat.</p>

<p>“All right! Go to it,” cried Tom Gray, setting them the example by
dismounting and removing the saddle from his horse.</p>

<p>As the day began to dawn, the girls gazed interestedly at the terraced
forest, at the green carpet of mountain meadowland that lay at their
feet through which flowed a sparkling stream of water, then up at the
dawning day. It was then that Grace made a discovery.</p>

<p>“Why, Tom, we have been traveling north, not south!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Too true, Loyalheart,” answered Captain Gray with a jolly note in his
voice.</p>

<p>“Then we are not on our way home?” cried Nora.</p>

<p>“No. We are going on into the Cascades, in the foothills of which we now
are. We are going to find Stacy, and then—perhaps we shall find
something else. First, folks, we shall have to meet and reckon with the
bandits of the range. They are determined that we shall not make a move
that they do not check.”</p>

<p>“Do—do you think they are watching us now, Tom?” begged Emma with
concern.</p>

<p>“Possibly, but I rather think they are fully occupied at present. I will
let you into a secret. The purpose of leaving Elfreda’s gold and the old
prospector’s diary was to trap the bandits and attack them.”</p>

<p>“Who will attack them?” Elfreda asked.</p>

<p>“Certain officers of the law who were lying in wait about the camp even
before you left there. It was a battle on our campground that you
heard—a battle between the officers and the bandits of the range. We
will now get breakfast and have forty winks of sleep, provided we are
not interrupted.”</p>

<p>Sleep was welcome, even more so than breakfast. The meal was quickly
disposed of and the Overlanders lay down with their clothes on, Tom
advising them to be ready to move at an instant’s notice.</p>

<p>They had not been asleep long ere the crash of a rifle brought all
members of the party to their feet.</p>

<p>“Lie down and stay down!” commanded Captain Gray, setting the example by
throwing himself to the ground. Tom knew what the others did not—that a
rifle bullet had sped low over the spot occupied by the Overlanders.</p>

<p>Then came a heavy scattering fire from two sides of the mountain meadow,
and now they could plainly hear the bullets singing overhead.</p>

<p>Frightened, Emma Dean sprang up to run to the cover of the trees and as
she ran they saw her throw up her hands.</p>

<p>“I’m hit! Oh, I’m shot!” she cried, and pitched forward in the deep
meadow grass.</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XXI</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>STACY SEEKS A CHANGE</span>
</h2>

<p>When Stacy Brown awakened from the sleep into which his captors had put
him, he was lying across the back of a horse.</p>

<p>At first the fat boy didn’t know what had occurred; then he recalled
that there had been a struggle in his tent and that a hand on his throat
had nearly choked him to death. A few seconds after that he lost
consciousness. And now he was being carried away on horseback. “Let me
up! Let me up!” he shouted.</p>

<p>A prod from a heavy boot caused him to utter a loud howl.</p>

<p>“Shut up!” commanded the man behind him in the saddle on the same horse.</p>

<p>“Le—let me up and I will. I’ll yell all the way if you don’t,” persisted
Stacy.</p>

<p>The boy’s hands were bound to his sides, and his ankles were tied
together.</p>

<p>For reasons of his own, the rider halted the horse and dismounted. He
then released the boy’s ankles, and slightly loosened the leather thongs
that hound his arms, but there he stopped.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you going to untie me?” demanded Stacy.</p>

<p>“Hold your tongue. You’ll be lucky if I don’t clout you over the head.
You hang onto me now. If you try any tricks I’ll finish you with a
bullet between the eyes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, wow!” wailed the fat boy. “Where you going to take me?”</p>

<p>“None of your business! Is it any of your business?” The fellow thrust
the muzzle of a revolver into Stacy’s face.</p>

<p>“N—n—n—no! It isn’t any of my business,” chattered the boy. He was
thrown astride the horse; then his captor mounted in front of him, and
Stacy clung to the fellow’s shirt with the tips of his fingers.</p>

<p>It was an awful ride, Stacy slipping from side to side with each gallop
of the mount, the perspiration streaming down his face from his efforts
and the nervous strain.</p>

<p>The ride continued for what seemed hours; then the horseman having
halted uttered a sharp, short whistle, which, being answered, he rode
ahead. Two men with rifles loomed out of the darkness and peered up at
the riders.</p>

<p>“Got him?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Where’s the other one?”</p>

<p>“In the shack. We don’t want to put this one there. They mustn’t get
close enough together to talk. We’ll put him in the trough.”</p>

<p><i>The trough!</i> Stacy began having visions of a ducking in cold mountain
water, which thought made him shiver. He was forcibly removed from the
horse and made to walk, with a cold hand at the back of his neck. He was
taken but a short distance from the horse, then, after his feet had been
tied and the arm bonds tightened, Chunky was rolled into what, at home,
would have been called a ditch. Here, it was a narrow channel that had
been cut through the rocks by water. This was the “trough,” and Stacy
was left alone there, while his captors walked away.</p>

<p>It was not long after their departure that he heard excited voices. They
were hurrying towards him.</p>

<p>“Hey, you feller there!”</p>

<p>“Well, what do you want?” growled the boy in the “trough.”</p>

<p>“He’s all right. I hope the boys kotch the rest of ’em. Don’t make no
difference whether it’s dead or alive so long as we’ve got two of ’em.”</p>

<p>Stacy pricked up his ears at this. He wondered to whom they referred.</p>

<p>“Come out of that!” ordered one of the men.</p>

<p>“I can’t fall up. Take me out if you want me.”</p>

<p>Stacy was yanked from the “trough” with far from gentle hands, his bonds
were removed, and he was permitted to walk, guarded by the men. Some
little distance from the “trough” they rounded a rock and came upon a
small campfire, near which sat two other men, and rough, hard-faced men
they were. They eyed him with menacing eyes. Stacy did not like the
looks of them.</p>

<p>“Who be ye?” demanded one of the two by the fire.</p>

<p>“Name’s Brown. Who are you?”</p>

<p>“What you doing up in these woods?”</p>

<p>“Riding for my health, but it’s the most unhealthy place I ever got
into.”</p>

<p>“Know anything ’bout a diary that a fellow named Petersen—a hoss
thief—got robbed of by one of your party?”</p>

<p>“My party never robbed anybody,” objected Stacy indignantly.</p>

<p>“Shut up! Answer me.”</p>

<p>“How can I answer you and shut up at the same time?”</p>

<p>The man addressed sprang up and struck the fat boy with the flat of his
hand and Stacy toppled over.</p>

<p>“You’re a coward! A miserable sneak—”</p>

<p><i>Whack!</i> A second slap laid the boy flat on the ground again. He got up,
red of face and raging within.</p>

<p>“If I had a gun you wouldn’t dare do that, you ruffian!”</p>

<p>“Here’s a gun,” answered the bandit, thrusting a revolver towards the
Overland boy.</p>

<p>Stacy shrugged his shoulders, but did not take the weapon.</p>

<p>“I—I don’t like to hurt anyone. I—I—I have an aversion to taking human
life, and if I were to take that weapon I’m afraid I might forget myself
and shoot someone,” stammered the fat boy.</p>

<p>The bandits laughed.</p>

<p>“Called your bluff, didn’t I?” sneered the fellow.</p>

<p>“No. I said if I had a gun you wouldn’t dare do that. Not having a gun I
suppose you can do as you like—this time.”</p>

<p>“Sit down thar. I want you to write a letter to your folks back there
and tell them that they got to leave the book that one of ’em stole from
Petersen, and the bag of gold, too, under a stone on top of the rock
behind the camp, and then git out.”</p>

<p>“You mean that I can go then—after I have written the note?” questioned
the boy with a hopeful note in his voice.</p>

<p>“I didn’t say nothing of the kind.”</p>

<p>“Then I won’t write it!” declared Stacy with emphasis.</p>

<p>Another whack from the bandit’s ham-like paw sent the boy staggering.</p>

<p>“Listen, young feller. This ain’t no joke. Whether or not you go back at
all ain’t worrying me, but I’ll tell you this much. You write that
letter and say in it that if your folks don’t do as you tell them to,
we’re going to shoot you to-morrow. Mebby we’ll do it anyway, and that’s
what’s coming to you if you don’t write. Will you write the letter?”</p>

<p>“I’ll write it,” agreed the fat boy. “Give me something to write with.”
Stacy labored over that letter, and his forehead and face were wet with
perspiration while he was doing it. If he failed to convey the message,
he believed the bandits really would make way with him, and if the
Overlanders did not obey the order of the bandits, he was positive the
bandits would carry out their threat. For these reasons Stacy Brown took
more care in composing that letter than he had ever done before in
writing a letter.</p>

<p>It was this message that, some time later, landed in the camp of the
Overlanders on the flaming arrow, shot to them by a half-breed Indian.</p>

<p>“Read it,” commanded the bandit.</p>

<p>Stacy did, whereupon the bandits with heads close together read it over
laboriously, one holding the message close to the fire for better light.
The one who appeared to be the leader handed it to a companion.</p>

<p>“See that the ‘squaw-man’ pushes that through by the air road,” he
ordered. “It’s got to go through in a hurry or somebody’ll suffer. Git!”</p>

<p>“Cap’n!” cried a voice, and a man dashed around the corner of the rock
that protected the bandits. “He’s gone! He’s vamoosed. Don’t know how,
but some varmint cut the ropes and let him out.”</p>

<p>“Gone! Go after him, men! What are you standing ’round here for? Get
him, dead or alive! Nail that boy first! Never mind, I’ll do it. I’ll—!”
The bandit paused suddenly and a blank look appeared on his face.
“Whe—whe—where is he?”</p>

<p>Stacy Brown was not there. He had taken advantage of the interruption,
and bounded away.</p>

<p>“You need a change, Stacy Brown, and you’re going to have it, if your
legs hold out,” growled the boy as he bounded away into the forest.</p>

</h2>

<p>“Emma’s hit!” wailed Nora, as the girls sprang up at Emma Dean’s cry and
the tumble that they saw her take.</p>

<p>“Get down!” commanded Tom Gray. “You’ll be hit.”</p>

<p>Not one of the three girls gave heed to his warning. Elfreda, Grace and
Nora ran to the spot at which they had seen Emma pitch forward.</p>

<p>Elfreda was the first to reach her. Emma lay moaning, both hands pressed
to her right cheek.</p>

<p>“Where were you hit, dear?” questioned Miss Briggs with no trace of
excitement in her voice.</p>

<p>“In my cheek. I thi—think the bullet went clear through.”</p>

<p>“If it had you wouldn’t be talking to me now. Take your hand away,
please,” directed Elfreda.</p>

<p>Emma would not do so, so Grace stretched forth a hand and forcibly
removed Emma’s hand from her face. A red blotch on the cheek with a
small white center were the only indications that something really had
hit the girl. Elfreda examined the spot, and a smile rippled over her
face.</p>

<p>“You poor child! No bullet even grazed you, but something did sting
you,” announced Elfreda. “I think it is a bee sting. Did you feel stings
anywhere else?”</p>

<p>“Yes. On the other cheek, but not so bad there,” gasped Emma. “That’s
why I thought the bullet had gone through.”</p>

<p>“This is one instance in your life when you should have demonstrated,”
declared Miss Briggs. “You see how easy it is to imagine things, and
suffer because you imagine.”</p>

<p>Emma sat up and smiled.</p>

<p>The shooting was still going on from the borders of the meadow, though
the firing was not so rapid as before, both sides apparently sparing
their ammunition, but enough shots were being fired to make it most
uncomfortable for the Overlanders who were directly in line of the
firing between the two opposing forces.</p>

<p>Tom joined the girls and led them to a safer place behind some huge
boulders, where he sternly ordered them to remain until he gave them
permission to change positions. Tom, rifle in hand, then crept out to a
place where he could get a better view of what was going on. As he
reached a point of vantage a double blast of fire overhead greeted him;
then the firing ceased altogether.</p>

<p>It was then that the Overlander discovered a man creeping around the far
end of the meadow. Then he saw another man creeping out from the
opposite side of the field, and realized that the two men were stalking
each other.</p>

<p>“Keep low, girls!” he called softly. “Something is coming off here if
I’m not mistaken.”</p>

<p>Instead of keeping low four heads quickly bobbed up from behind the
boulders. At first the girls saw nothing unusual; then they discovered
what Tom had just seen. They could see both men at intervals as the
men’s heads came up.</p>

<p>“Girls!” Grace snatched her field glasses and directed them at the
creeping man on their side of the meadow.</p>

<p>“Wha—what is it?” cried Nora.</p>

<p>“The Peanut Man—it’s Jim Haley! There—see!” She passed her glasses to
Elfreda who took a long look.</p>

<p>“You are right, Grace. What does it mean?”</p>

<p>“That we have friends here, J. Elfreda, but I fear something terrible is
going to happen. Look!”</p>

<p>The two men had seen each other as their heads were cautiously raised
above the tall grass, and both exchanged shots with their revolvers at
identically the same second. Then they both ducked back to the
protection of the meadow grass.</p>

<p>Jim Haley was on his feet a few seconds later.</p>

<p>“Come out, you sneaking cur!” he shouted. “Stand up like a man!”</p>

<p>The taunt was too much for Haley’s adversary. The fellow leaped to his
feet, and, as he leaped, he fired. So did Haley. Neither scored, and, so
far as the Overlanders could observe, not a human being except
themselves saw the duel that was being fought out there in the meadow.
Haley’s adversary ducked, and the Overlanders saw what his strategy was.
A slight waving of the grass told them that the fellow was crawling to
the left. They did not know whether or not Haley saw that.</p>

<p>A moment or so later the man again sprang up and fired, but the Peanut
Man had not been deceived. His revolver banged so quickly that the
watchers could not tell which man fired first.</p>

<p>“Good for Jim Haley!” cried Tom Gray.</p>

<p>“Don’t!” admonished Grace. “Tom, don’t forget that this may end in a
tragedy.”</p>

<p>“That’s what it is going to end in—perhaps more than one tragedy. When
Haley and the other fellow wind up you will see more lively work, and—”</p>

<p>“Hippy! Oh, where is my Hippy?” cried Nora.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry. He has gone to join some of the men who are backing
Haley,” replied Tom.</p>

<p>Neither Haley nor his opponent ducked after that and to the Overland
girls, terrible as it was, it was a wonderful thing to see the two men
standing up in the meadow shooting at each other as calmly as though
they were firing at targets.</p>

<p>Emma Dean’s face was pale, and her whole body was trembling with
excitement.</p>

<p>A little cry from one of the girls greeted a new move on the part of
Haley’s antagonist. The fellow suddenly whipped out another revolver,
and began shooting with both guns at the same time.</p>

<p>Jim Haley demonstrated that he, too, could do that, and he did, and the
bullets flew thick and fast. Then suddenly they saw Haley’s enemy spin
half way around.</p>

<p>“He’s hit!” cried Nora.</p>

<p>The man was hit, and Haley held his fire. But the Peanut Man’s adversary
came back with two more shots, both of which grazed Haley’s body. Then,
like a flash, Jim Haley fired two shots at the same instant. His
adversary turned slowly and then pitched sideways to the ground.</p>

<p>Haley himself went down almost as suddenly, the difference being that
Haley was not hurt, but he knew what to expect after his adversary had
fallen seriously wounded.</p>

<p>The crash of rifles was heard on the opposite side of the meadow, but
there was no reply from the Overland side.</p>

<p>“Where are they? Oh, where are Hippy and the people he is with?” cried
Nora.</p>

<p>“I think they are on the other side of the meadow among the trees,
creeping toward their enemies,” answered Grace Harlowe. “Two parties are
shooting over on that side now.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Tom. “You have it right, Grace. The Peanut Man offered
himself as a possible sacrifice to enable his companions to work around
to the other side of the meadow and attack the enemy on their own
ground.”</p>

<p>“But where is Mr. Haley? Are you sure that he wasn’t hit?” begged Emma.</p>

<p>“No. I could see by the way he went down that it was to avoid the volley
that he knew would be fired at him,” Tom informed them. “Girls, I am in
hopes that this morning’s work may mark the finish of the job that
certain men have been sent up here to accomplish.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand,” said Elfreda, interested at once.</p>

<p>“You will later,” was Captain Gray’s noncommittal answer.</p>

<p>“Should we move from here, Tom?” questioned Grace a little
apprehensively. “The firing has stopped.”</p>

<p>“No. We must wait here. That is the arrangement, no matter which way the
fight goes. We must be on our guard, so get your rifles and sit down
behind the boulders, while I keep watch here.”</p>

<p>The Overland party obeyed, but not willingly. They had come out from
their hiding place to watch the duel, and preferred not to miss further
operations, but Tom was insistent.</p>

<p>It was well past noon when a loud hello brought the girls to their feet.
The call was uttered by Hippy.</p>

<p>“I had an awful time getting here without crossing the meadow. I didn’t
know what I might run into out there, so I came around through the
forest, and it was mighty rough going. Got anything loose around here?”
he demanded.</p>

<p>“Saddle rations; that is all,” replied Grace. “Help yourself to whatever
you can find.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Hippy, have you seen anything of Hamilton?” begged Emma anxiously.</p>

<p>“Yes. Why?”</p>

<p>“Is—is he all right?”</p>

<p>“He was beating up Hawk Murray with his fists and doing it beautifully,
the last I saw of him,” answered Hippy. “Never saw a fellow with a
better punch than ‘Hamilton,’ as you call him, has.”</p>

<p>“Hippy, what about the man out there in the meadow?” asked Miss Briggs.
“I am going out there. He may not be dead, and it is inhuman to leave
him there to suffer, even if he is an enemy. Who is he? Do you know,
Hippy?”</p>

<p>“Yes. That fellow is Two-gun Murray, the slickest man with a revolver
that ever hunched a shoulder, and you will please stay away from him.”</p>

<p>“Tom,” said Grace, laying a hand on her husband’s arm, “I wish someone
would go out there. Perhaps it isn’t wise that any of us girls should do
so, but we are not afraid, if you will permit. Please!”</p>

<p>“Come along, Hippy. I guess it is up to us,” urged Captain Gray.</p>

<p>Hippy protested that he must have food, but Nora promised that, if he
would go out, she would have a nice meal ready for him when he returned,
so the two men, with drawn revolvers, walked out cautiously to the spot
where the mountain bandit had fallen. He was not at the exact spot where
he had fallen, but they had no difficulty in following the trail which
he had left.</p>

<p>They found Two-gun alive, but unconscious, and a few moments later they
were on their way back to camp, carrying the heavy burden. The Overland
girls, knowing that the man was still alive because Tom and Hippy were
carrying him so carefully, were ready with water, bandages and
antiseptics, to give first aid.</p>

<p>“Where is he hit?” was Elfreda’s first question.</p>

<p>“Both shoulders,” answered Tom briefly.</p>

<p>Grace and Elfreda began working on the bandit immediately, and in half
an hour he regained consciousness. The girls found that Two-gun was
seriously wounded, both bullets having gone through him. They said that
he should be taken to some place where surgical aid might be had, but
Tom said that was impossible. All that could be done had been done.
Further, he said that men of his type were fairly well used to being
shot up. No vital spot had been hit and both Tom and Hippy were of the
opinion that Two-gun would live to spend at least a few years in prison.
This bandit, however, probably had never before enjoyed the really
tender treatment such as the girls were giving him. He followed
Elfreda’s every movement with his eyes.</p>

<p>“I—I didn’t tell on you—about the saddle and the hoss,” he said weakly.</p>

<p>“I know it,” answered Miss Briggs. “That is one reason why I am trying
to take good care of you. But you must be quiet and conserve your
strength.”</p>

<p>“Who was the fellow that got me?” demanded Two-gun.</p>

<p>“That I cannot tell you, Mr. Murray,” replied Elfreda.</p>

<p>“He was some handy with the gun, I’ll say, Miss.”</p>

<p>Elfreda moved away from Two-gun, and asked anxiously if any word had
been had of Stacy. None had. She then suggested to Tom that the wounded
bandit might be able to give them information that would lead to finding
Stacy, so Tom asked Two-gun if he knew of Stacy’s whereabouts. The
bandit shook his head. He said he knew that two members of the Overland
party had been captured, but that he had not learned what had become of
the prisoners.</p>

<p>“There is one of them,” Captain Gray informed him, pointing to Hippy.
“Were both men taken to the same place?”</p>

<p>“They might have been,” was the reply, and that was all that could be
elicited from Two-gun Murray.</p>

<p>There was nothing now to be done save to wait until the men, who had
tricked the bandits and saved the Overlanders from probable serious
consequences, advised them what to do; so the party made themselves as
comfortable as possible, sleeping part of the time and taking turns at
watching the camp and Two-gun Murray.</p>

<p>At night their vigil was redoubled, for none knew how many of Two-gun’s
companions were at large. They knew that some had been captured, as
Hippy Wingate had told them so, and that Ham White had had a fist fight
with Hawk Murray, the leader of the band of marauders that had terrified
the entire Cascade Range.</p>

<p>It was well after midnight when the camp was hailed. Tom answered the
hail.</p>

<p>“Come forward with your hands up and identify yourself,” he ordered.</p>

<p>“Yeow!” howled a voice that brought every member of the Overland party
to his feet.</p>

<p>“Stacy!” shouted the Overlanders.</p>

<p>“Wha—what!” exclaimed Tom Gray as an Indian loped into camp, a rifle in
his hand, which he kept pointed in the direction of Captain Gray.</p>

</h2>

<p>“Me Cat-foot Charlie. Me come!”</p>

<p>“Yes. He’s the cat and I’m the foot,” answered another voice, and Stacy
Brown strolled into camp with his chest thrown out. “I’ve been captured,
sentenced to death, and, being the foot, I did some fast footwork, and
here I am. Old chap Pussy here found me and brought me back. Oh, no, I
wasn’t lost. I never know where I am, anyway. He showed me the way.
Who—”</p>

<p>“Our sweet dreams of peace are now at an end,” complained Emma.</p>

<p>Stacy did not heed her words nor the congratulations of his companions
who were happier than words could express to have him with them again.
The fat boy was interested in the man who lay by the fire.</p>

<p>“Who’s that?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“His name is Murray,” answered Lieutenant Wingate. “He and Jim Haley
fought a duel to-day, and Two-gun—that is the man’s name—got a bit the
worst of it.”</p>

<p>“Two-gun Murray! Hey, you! I’m wise to you. You’re the fellow that stole
my fish—the same person that I clouted over the head. You say he is
wounded, Uncle Hip?”</p>

<p>“Yes, seriously so.”</p>

<p>“Think it would do much harm if I were to give him another wallop over
the head—just for luck, you know?”</p>

<p>“Stacy!” Tom Gray’s voice was stern. “Get away from that man and let him
alone!”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right, but I would like to give him just one clout. It’s coming
to him.”</p>

<p>Captain Gray took firm hold of the fat boy’s collar and projected him to
some distance from the wounded man.</p>

<p>“Cat-foot, have you word for me?” demanded Tom.</p>

<p>The Indian grunted and handed Tom a message. It was from Hamilton White,
and the smile that lighted up the captain’s face as he read it, told the
Overland Riders that it contained good news.</p>

<p>“We are to move as soon as we can pack up,” announced Tom. “Cat-foot
will accompany us.” That was all Captain Gray would say.</p>

<p>Emma, whose curiosity was proverbial, pouted and complained that every
one of the party seemed to think it smart to make a mystery of
everything.</p>

<p>After offering the Indian food, which he refused and sat down by
himself, the Overlanders quizzed Stacy about what had happened to him.
Stacy told what he knew of his capture, and of the incidents that
followed. In the course of the conversation it developed that Cat-foot
Charlie had been sent to pick up the fat boy’s trail and follow it until
he found him. Hamilton White had brought that about.</p>

<p>Cat-foot had gone to the scene of Hippy’s imprisonment and from there
soon found Stacy’s trail. This was made the easier because he had
eavesdropped on two of the bandits and learned how Stacy got away.</p>

<p>“Fat boy, him run like Indian chased by bad spirits,” announced the
Indian when asked about the chase.</p>

<p>Stacy, it developed, discovered that the Indian was chasing him, and
from that moment on it was a race, the frightened Overlander making top
speed to drop his pursuer. The race ended when Cat-foot finally overtook
him, leaped on the boy’s back, and held him until he had explained what
he wanted. Stacy’s courage thereupon returned.</p>

<p>“Our fallen hero,” observed Emma when the tale was finished.</p>

<p>“Yes, but I didn’t get shot,” retorted Stacy.</p>

<p>The Overlanders laughed heartily at Stacy’s retort, for it was a rap at
Emma, though the boy did not know it. He laughed with them just the
same.</p>

<p>“Where are we going?” Nora wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Northwest,” answered Tom briefly. “You will know all about it within
twenty-four hours. The question is, what are we to do with our wounded
man. We surely can’t leave him here. Cat-foot, do you know this fellow?”</p>

<p>“Me know.”</p>

<p>“What do you think we had better do with him?”</p>

<p>“Shoot um!” was the prompt reply of the Indian.</p>

<p>“Pussy, you are a man of rare judgment,” complimented Stacy, grinning at
the Indian.</p>

<p>“It is what one would expect from one savage to another,” murmured Emma.</p>

<p>“What did the Chief say about it?” demanded Tom. “I mean Mr. White.”</p>

<p>“Chief say me stay. Men come git Two-gun.”</p>

<p>“Why do you call Hamilton the Chief?” wondered Emma.</p>

<p>“How many of the bandits did they get?” questioned Tom, ignoring Emma’s
inquiry.</p>

<p>“Not know.”</p>

<p>“Very well, I will turn Two-gun over to you, but, Cat-foot, if you do
one little thing to disturb that man you will have to answer to me. When
he asks for a drink, give it to him and say nothing—say nothing at all
to him at any time unless he wants something. You also will be held
responsible for his not getting away, and after the men take him, unless
you get different orders from the Chief, you will come to us at
Three-Mile Pass. That’s all, except that we will leave food for you and
Two-gun.”</p>

<p>At Tom’s direction all hands began packing, making ready for another
night journey. Stacy complained bitterly, saying he hadn’t had a night’s
sleep in so long that his eyelids hung down over his cheeks.</p>

<p>“Where are we going, anyway?” he wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Three-Mile Pass, you heard me say. Do you know where that is?” returned
Captain Gray.</p>

<p>“No. Do you?”</p>

<p>Tom said he had a fair idea of its location. Though tired and somewhat
nervous, the Overland girls prepared for the journey with their usual
cheerfulness, and were under way in an hour. Tom selected an unsuspected
pass as the route from the meadow, and the riders were soon swallowed up
in its deep gloom. It seemed as though night had poured the blackest of
her coloring into this pass, but the trail was fairly smooth and one
could not stray from it without bumping into the rocks.</p>

<p>No halt was made until daylight. Then the party stopped for breakfast,
and, while there, horses were heard approaching. The girls were
startled, and looked to Tom for orders, but Captain Gray merely smiled.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry; only some guests for breakfast,” he said.</p>

<p>“It’s Hamilton!” cried Emma Dean, as two horsemen rode into sight.</p>

<p>“And the Peanut Man,” added Nora joyously.</p>

<p>“Put over a fresh pot of coffee,” suggested Grace. “They look tired, and
goodness knows one, at least, has a right to be tired.”</p>

<p>“Peanuts, peanuts, ladies and gentlemen!” called Jim Haley. “The
International product has reached to the utmost limits of the Cascades
already, and will soon be over the border. Howdy, folks!”</p>

<p>It was a real welcome that the Overlanders gave the two men. Elfreda and
Grace were studying the face of Haley, with the same thought in the mind
of each. Could this carefree, temperamental Haley be the Haley that they
had seen facing the bandit gunman calmly, never flinching under the
bandit’s fire, and in the end downing his man? It did not seem possible.</p>

<p>“How did you make out with your patient?” he asked, his face suddenly
assuming a grave expression as he shook hands with Miss Briggs.</p>

<p>“His wounds were serious, but, if he is not neglected, I think he will
pull through.”</p>

<p>“He will not be neglected where he is going,” was the significant reply.
“The officers have taken him away from your last camp by now, so don’t
worry. After a snack we will have a talk all around.”</p>

<p>The breakfast from then on was a happy reunion, and even Elfreda Briggs
forgot to be distant towards Hamilton White. Emma managed to sit beside
him, her face wearing a most devoted look.</p>

<p>When the dishes had been put away, the party settled down to talk over
their experiences, and after a little Tom Gray cleared his throat and
announced that he had something to say.</p>

<p>“You Overlanders have accused some of us of all the time making a
mystery of everything. While clearing myself, there are others present
whom I wish to clear of any suspicion of doing other than their duty.</p>

<p>“Here are the facts: When I came up here with my wife and her party, I
was supposed to come as a forester, but as a matter of fact I came on
quite another mission. For a long time tourists and others have been
preyed upon by mountain bandits, the Guerrillas of the Cascades, as some
call them. As a forester here for a survey it was thought that I might
get a line, so to speak, on the gang and its lair without them
suspecting me. I did that to a certain extent. Then, too, there was a
famous government forester who came to Washington State on the same
mission. He thought he could best look over the ground by joining out
with a party of tourists, and he was unfortunate enough to fall in with
the Overland Riders. That man knew these forests and mountains, and,
after finishing this particular mission, he is to be the chief of the
foresters, which, in fact, he is already.”</p>

<p>“Hamilton White!” cried Nora.</p>

<p>Tom Gray nodded.</p>

<p>“And he has done his work well. In addition to that he has been a
wonderful guide and a delightful companion to you folks.”</p>

<p>“Even if he did deceive us,” said Elfreda.</p>

<p>“Not all of us,” spoke up Grace, who then told of the wigwagging
incident when she learned that he was the chief of the foresters through
doing some signaling on her own account.</p>

<p>Ham White laughed heartily.</p>

<p>“I suspected something of the sort,” he added with a chuckle.</p>

<p>“To continue my story,” resumed Captain Gray, “another man came to us
sailing under false colors, if you wish to call it that. This man
proposed that the Overlanders be used as a decoy to lure the bandits on,
knowing that the ruffians believed one of our party possessed the key to
Sam Petersen’s gold find. Ham White objected to subjecting us to peril,
but when the newcomer showed him orders from the Washington authorities
directing White to coöperate fully with him and carry out his orders,
White was obliged to obey.”</p>

<p>The eyes of the Overland Riders turned toward Jim Haley, who actually
grew rosy under their accusing gaze.</p>

<p>“Don’t look at me that way. I confess, but you shall have your peanuts
just the same,” he promised laughingly.</p>

<p>“Folks, know Jim Haley, chief of the special agents,” introduced Tom.
“Between White and Haley the entire band of guerrillas, with one
exception, has been rounded up. Some are on their way to stand trial,
others are being conveyed to a hospital to be treated for their wounds,
and two are dead. They have spied on this party, watched their every
move ever since they came into the Washington forests, and especially so
since Sam Petersen died from a gunshot wound inflicted by one of the
Murrays.”</p>

<p>“How perfectly thrilling!” breathed Emma Dean.</p>

<p>“The big round-up came yesterday when the bandits were preparing to make
a mass attack on our camp, but Haley outwitted them. They did not know
that a body of forest rangers and sheriff’s deputies were secreted on
your side of the meadow, ready not only to defend you, but to capture
the ruffians who were about to try to take you and force information
from you. It was Haley who, as you know, went out to meet Two-gun
Murray, and beat him in a standup gun duel,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“Captain! Please talk about the weather,” begged Haley amid laughter.</p>

<p>“They didn’t find out about the gold mine after all, did they?” chuckled
Hippy. “Say, Haley, I know you, you old rascal! You’re the fellow with a
cold who rescued me from the bandits,” he accused, and Haley agreed with
a nod.</p>

<p>“Speaking of gold, Hippy Wingate,” spoke up Elfreda Briggs, “I think I
am entitled to an explanation. How did you chance to have my bag of gold
in your possession?”</p>

<p>“Ham White gave it to me, and told me to hang onto it—that it wasn’t
safe for you to carry it around.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!”</p>

<p>“I took it from the bunk where Petersen lay, before you came in the
shack that day. I expected that the gang would return, so I scraped up
some pebbles and substituted them for the gold, replacing the canvas bag
where I found it,” explained Ham White.</p>

<p>“Was it you who exchanged shots with Two-gun Murray that day?” she
asked.</p>

<p>Ham nodded, and Elfreda bent an accusing glance on Stacy Brown.</p>

<p>“Well, I saved you from that ruffian, didn’t I?” protested the fat boy.</p>

<p>“Yes, Stacy, and I forgive you for trying to make me think you had
suffered the bandit to shoot at you while you lay behind a bush,” smiled
Elfreda.</p>

<p>“Not if my legs were in good working order. I wouldn’t lie behind any
bush or anything else and let a sure-thing gunman blaze away at me,”
declared Stacy Brown with an earnestness that raised a merry peal of
laughter.</p>

<p>“Time to break camp,” announced Tom Gray. “We can chatter after we have
made a new camp, which will not be many miles from here.”</p>

<p>“Where are we bound for?” asked Hippy.</p>

<p>“Three Mile Pass.” Captain Gray’s face wore a broad smile, and Grace,
knowing him so well, regarded him suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Tom has something up his sleeve,” Grace confided in Elfreda.</p>

<p>“They all have,” observed Miss Briggs. “These honest men who have opened
their hearts to us have not yet opened the aforesaid hearts far enough.”</p>

<p>“Boots and saddles!” cried Hippy, and the Overland Riders with their
guests took to their mounts. It was a happy ride that morning; the air
was cool, birds were twittering, and Hippy was trying to sing, his
efforts in that direction raising a perfect storm of protest.</p>

<p>No stop was made, except now and then to water the horses, until nearly
noon. Then they halted, apparently for no cause at all, the visitors and
Tom Gray fussing with saddle girths, all the time regarded narrowly by
Grace and Elfreda.</p>

<p>At last they started on through a rapidly broadening pass, following the
dry course of a mountain stream. The sunlight flooded the pass as their
trail bore more to the right, and at the turn Tom Gray held up his hand,
a signal to halt.</p>

<p>“Oh, look at the Old Lady of the Mountain!” yelled Stacy. “Yes, she’s
got a kid on either side of her. Ha, ha, ha!” he laughed.</p>

<p>“Elfreda!” Grace gripped the arm of her companion. “‘Lost River—Grandma
and the Children—Three Peaks dead east.’ Look! There are the peaks. The
sun is at the meridian. Oh, Elfreda!”</p>

<p>“And look—the yellow sands of Lost River. Oh, Grace! If it should be
only a dream I’d faint, after all I have been through to get here. See!
The old lady’s face is black as ink, just as that poor, unhappy old
prospector said it was.”</p>

<p>“Children, do you know where you are?” called Captain Gray, none of the
party having heard the exclamations of Grace and Elfreda.</p>

<p>“Yes, Tom Gray. I am sitting on my gold mine,” answered Miss Briggs,
trying to control her voice and keep her elation out of it.</p>

<p>“Why, Elfreda! I thought you did not want a gold mine—that you wished to
hear nothing more about the hateful subject,” chided Grace.</p>

<p>“I think I—I have the fever, and—” confessed Elfreda.</p>

<p>“You are in fact sitting on your gold mine. When I learned that Lost
River was at the feet of Grandma and the Children, with Three Peaks dead
east, I recognized the description instantly, for I had been here, and
was impressed with the odd formations to be seen here,” said Captain
Gray. “You will recall the words of the old prospector in the diary and
on the sheet on which you wrote down what he told you. I was here trying
to locate the headquarters of the Murrays, and, for your information, we
are less than half a mile from the lair of the Guerrillas of the
Cascades—the Murrays. Such is the irony of fate,” added Tom.</p>

<p>“Gold! Hooray!” yelled Stacy, tossing his hat into the air. “I hope it
doesn’t turn out to be iron.”</p>

<p>“Please don’t get excited,” admonished Grace. “We are not certain that
there is any gold here.”</p>

<p>“Any gold here?” answered Tom. “Ham, tell them what you know.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Gray, when I left you so mysteriously I came up here at Captain
Gray’s direction to make a thorough survey—to find out, if possible, if
Petersen’s was an idle dream or the real thing. It was real! I have
already panned enough of the sand of Lost River through my fingers to
make a fair meal ticket for this party. It is true that we have not
found the real vein, but we know it cannot be far from here, and we are
going to search for it.”</p>

<p>“Say! Whose gold mine is this?” demanded Lieutenant Hippy Wingate.</p>

<p>“Whose? Why, Miss Briggs’, of course,” answered Ham White. “I have sent
a trusty ranger to Seattle to file her claim, which we have staked out
broadly, and we are in hopes that it may take in the mother lode. In any
event, we are on the ground, and we will broaden our claim so that you
may be protected. Am I forgiven for all the deception I have practiced
on you and Miss Briggs and the others?” asked White, addressing Grace.</p>

<p>“It is for us to ask your pardon, Mr. White, for suspecting that you
were not what you seemed, or so it seemed to us at one time.”</p>

<p>Stacy had leaped from his horse and was digging feverishly in the sands
of Lost River.</p>

<p>“I got one! Whoopee!” he howled, holding up a “nugget” nearly as big as
an egg.</p>

<p>Hippy snatched the “nugget” from him and turned it over in his hand,
then broke into uproarious laughter.</p>

<p>“Why, you simp! That’s not a nugget, it is merely a piece of quartz. Dig
some more, Chunky.”</p>

<p>“I suggest that we do not lose our heads, and that we make camp and
behave,” cried Grace.</p>

<p>The Overlanders agreed, and in the happiest frame of mind they
dismounted and pitched their camp, after which they walked over the
claim with Tom, Mr. White and Haley as guides. On the way up the channel
of the dry stream Nora picked up three small nuggets of real gold.</p>

<p>“The luck of the Irish, me darlin’,” cried Nora, playfully patting Hippy
on the cheek.</p>

<p>“I wish it understood,” announced Elfreda after their return to camp,
“that this is not Elfreda Briggs’ claim, but the Overland Riders’
claim.”</p>

<p>“Too late,” answered Tom. “Your claim will be filed before you or anyone
else can stop it.”</p>

<p>“I will see about that,” murmured Elfreda.</p>

<p>That evening, by the campfire, the members of the party discussed their
good fortune, and made plans for the future.</p>

<p>Busy days followed, some of the party panning the sands of Lost River
for gold, and finding enough to arouse them to a high pitch of
excitement. There was no thought of continuing the journey, for there
was work to be done where they were. A mining expert had been sent for,
and his investigations were still in progress five weeks later when
Grace asked Tom to take her home.</p>

<p>Jim Haley had not remained long with them, for he, too, had work to do
in connection with evidence against the captured bandits.</p>

<p>The others of the party decided that they would return with Grace, but
Ham White, at Miss Briggs’ request, together with three former forest
rangers, remained on the claim to guard and work it, and assist in
locating, if possible, the rich vein that all believed could not be far
away.</p>

<p>“You are all coming to see us next winter at Haven Home,” reminded Grace
on the morning of their departure for Cresco, where they were to board a
train for the east—and Home! “It probably will be along about Christmas
time, that being the most joyous season for old friends to get together,
and we will have a Christmas tree and everything,” she added, laughing.</p>

<p>Good byes were said and the Overland Riders retraced their trail, the
last journey that, as a body, they probably ever would take. A week
later found them at their homes. Each had his own life to lead now, for
the years were drawing on, and the Overlanders were no longer children.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='chXXIV' title='XXIV: The House of Happiness'>
  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XXIV</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>THE HOUSE OF HAPPINESS</span>
</h2>

<p>Haven Home was brilliantly lighted, for it was Christmas eve, and Grace
had made good her promise to ask the Overland Riders to spend the
holiday week with her and Tom.</p>

<p>Haven Home was a house of happiness on that wonderful Christmas eve,
for, up in the nursery, lay a little pink and white bundle of humanity
over which the Overlanders bent—that is, the girls did—and worshiped at
the shrine of Grace Harlowe’s own little daughter, now less than four
weeks old. For that bit of humanity the whole party had come laden with
gifts, not forgetting many beautiful things for Yvonne, Grace’s adopted
daughter—the child that Grace had rescued from the cellar of a deserted
village amid the crashing of exploding German shells in the great world
war—now a beautiful young woman.</p>

<p>Hamilton White was there, big, brown and manly, a figure that attracted
attention where-ever he went; Jim Haley was there, too, with a load of
peanuts that required a wagon to carry them from the express office.</p>

<p>Elfreda had brought her adopted daughter, now home from a finishing
school, and a different child she was from the daughter of the Mad
Hermit that the Overlanders had taken to their hearts some years before.</p>

<p>But where was Stacy Brown? No one could answer the question. Stacy had
not even replied to the invitation to join the Christmas party, and
there was disappointment, for no reunion of the Overlanders could be
complete without the fat boy.</p>

<p>Emma Dean was monopolizing “Hamilton” most of the time, and Nora
confided to Grace that she actually believed it was going to be a
“match,” but Grace shook her head and smiled.</p>

<p>And then Stacy arrived!</p>

<p>The fat boy made his usual dramatic entrance at a moment when he knew
attention would be centered on him. It was.</p>

<p>Stacy was in full evening dress, carrying an opera hat, which he crushed
and popped open with one hand as he shook hands and bowed with a grace
that was unsuspected by his companions.</p>

<p>“Did you stop at the hotel to get into those glad rags?” demanded Hippy.</p>

<p>“We wondered why you were so late,” said Grace. “It never occurred to us
that you would stop to dress before coming up to the house. Why, if you
felt that you must dress, did you not come here? Your room has been
ready for several days.”</p>

<p>“Dress? Who said I stopped to dress? I dressed this morning before
leaving home.”</p>

<p>“Stacy!” cried Nora in a horrified tone.</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean that you wore your evening clothes all day on the
train?” demanded Nora.</p>

<p>“Sure I did. I didn’t want to put them in my suit case and wrinkle them
all up, so I wore them. Anything wrong about that?”</p>

<p>There was silence for a few seconds, then the Overlanders broke out in
peals of laughter.</p>

<p>“Say, I want to see the kid. <i>He</i> won’t laugh at me, I’ll bet,” said
Stacy.</p>

<p>“Wrong gender, young man,” observed Hippy.</p>

<p>“Of course you shall see him,” cried Grace, linking her arm in Stacy’s
and leading him upstairs, with the entire Overland party following.</p>

<p>Two little blue eyes looked up at him as Stacy gazed, and popped his
crush hat at the bundle of pink and white until the nurse took it away
from him indignantly.</p>

<p>“The perfect picture of Grace, isn’t she?” bubbled Emma.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. Cute little monkey, isn’t she?”</p>

<p>“Young man, you come downstairs,” ordered Hippy, collaring Stacy and
leading him away, while the Overlanders followed laughing. The merriment
had begun with the arrival of Stacy.</p>

<p>Dinner was announced as they reached the drawing room, and it was a
dinner that Stacy Brown did full justice to. It did the Overlanders’
hearts good to see him eat.</p>

<p>“How you ever managed to develop such an appetite, short of starvation,
is a thing that I have many times wondered at,” teased Tom.</p>

<p>“Develop it! I didn’t. It’s a gift,” was the fat boy’s quick response.
“I was born with it, and I don’t know why you folks are always making
fun of me,” he retorted, appearing to be very much hurt.</p>

<p>“That is because you are always making fun of yourself,” reminded Emma.</p>

<p>“Not when you are about,” mumbled Stacy.</p>

<p>And so the merriment went on.</p>

<p>At the close of the dinner Hamilton White made his mine report. The
mother lode of “Lost Mine” had just recently been tapped when work was
suspended for the winter, to be resumed in the early spring, he said.
The mining engineer in charge of the work was authority for the
statement that it would undoubtedly pan out a big fortune. White said he
had the expert’s detailed report which they could look over at their
leisure.</p>

<p>“So J. Elfreda is a rich woman, eh?” said Stacy, regarding her solemnly.</p>

<p>“Yes, rich in the sense that I have such friends as these,” answered
Elfreda, her eyes moist as she glanced at the eager, flushed faces about
her. “Gold is not riches—friendship is. As for the riches of the ‘Lost
Mine’ I have with me a transfer of title to the property, signed, sealed
and delivered, providing as follows:</p>

<p>“One eighth to the new baby.</p>

<p>“One eighth to my adopted daughter ‘Little Silver.’</p>

<p>“One eighth to Yvonne.</p>

<p>“One eighth each to Grace, Nora and Emma.</p>

<p>“And—” Elfreda paused, and in a subdued voice added, “one eighth each
for myself and for my husband to be.” A flush slowly grew into her
cheeks as J. Elfreda Briggs bent her eyes on the paper from which she
was reading.</p>

<p>“Your—your what?” stammered Nora, as all eyes were fixed on Miss Briggs’
face.</p>

<p>“My husband to be!” Elfreda raised her eyes, eyes full of happiness, to
her friends. “I am to wed Mr. White in the early spring. You, my beloved
friends, are the first to be told. Why should you not be first?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Hamilton, isn’t that perfectly wonderful!” cried Emma.</p>

<p>Emma had broken the ice, the dead silence that, for a few seconds, had
followed Elfreda Briggs’ announcement, and then the exclamations and the
congratulations fairly overwhelmed Elfreda and Hamilton White.</p>

<p>Everything else was forgotten.</p>

<p>“Well, old chappie, what have <i>you</i> got to say for <i>yourself</i>?” demanded
Hippy Wingate, frowning on “Ham” White.</p>

<p>“Only that I am the most fortunate of men,” answered Hamilton White
gravely.</p>

<p>“Never mind, Emma,” spoke up Grace smilingly as she looked into the
flushed face of Emma Dean. “I have named the baby—I just now named her,
and her name is Emma Grace Harlowe Gray.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the poor kid,” wailed Stacy. “To go through life with a name like
that! My heart of hearts bleeds for her.”</p>

<p>“For he’s a jolly good fellow,” struck up Tom Gray, whereupon Grace ran
to her piano and joined with the accompaniment, and the old house
resounded to the rollicking song until the nurse came down, her face
wearing a deep frown.</p>

<p>“Please, please!” she begged. “You have awakened the baby.”</p>

<p>The song stopped.</p>

<p>“Well, we are all set now except for Stacy Brown and Emma Dean. They are
our hopeless bachelors,” declared Hippy.</p>

<p>“Bachelors! I guess not,” retorted Stacy. “Emma and I have decided to
tie up, too.”</p>

<p>The Overlanders shouted. They thought it was one of Stacy’s jokes.</p>

<p>Then the Overlanders began to realize that Stacy was not joking.</p>

<p>“But how do you two expect to get along—you are fighting all the time?”
wondered Nora.</p>

<p>“The difference between us and some others is that we will have done all
our fighting before we were married. Am I right, Emma?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Stacy dear,” replied Emma, blushing furiously.</p>

<p>“When did all this take place?” asked Grace.</p>

<p>“Oh, we got engaged by the correspondence-school plan,” Stacy informed
her.</p>

<p>“The idea! Children like you two getting married,” objected Nora.</p>

<p>“Children? Huh! I’m twenty-three, and Emma—” Stacy shrugged his
shoulders. “Well, let her speak for herself. Anything else—anyone got
any questions to ask?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” spoke up Elfreda. “If I may do so without offense, I should like
to know what you propose to do after you marry Emma?”</p>

<p>“Nothing!” with rising inflection in his voice. “I have money, my little
wife will have more, and we two will live a life of distinguished and
elegant leisure.”</p>

<p>“You poor turtle doves,” chortled Hippy Wingate.</p>

<p>The merry moments that followed failed to soothe the wakeful baby
upstairs. After the excitement over the startling announcements had
abated, Grace proposed that they dress the Christmas tree, and,
following that, they danced for an hour, and the wonderful evening came
to a close—for all except Stacy and Emma. The two strolled out on the
snow-covered lawn of Haven Home, hand in hand, with the moon beaming
down upon them, and a million diamonds sparkling at their feet.</p>

<p>“Stacy dear, do you remember that night up in the North Woods when the
Overlanders were preparing to leave for home? Do you remember what Hippy
asked me as a snowbird chirped high up in a great tree, just as one is
now chirping in that apple tree yonder?” asked Emma.</p>

<p>“I remember,” nodded Stacy.</p>

<p>“Hippy asked me, ‘Emma, what is the little bird saying to-night?’ I
answered, ‘He is wishing us all a merry, merry Christmas and a glad,
happy new year.’ That is what the snowbird is saying to us from the old
apple tree to-night, isn’t he, Stacy dear?”</p>

<p>“You bet, kid. Wise guys, those snowbirds,” he observed as they turned
and strolled back towards the house. “We are going to be happy, aren’t
we, Emma?”</p>

<p>“Going to be? Why, we are happy now, dear. Say good-night to me out
here,” she whispered as they reached the veranda.</p>

<p>Stacy did so. He said good-night several times before they went indoors.
Emma Dean’s eyes were bright and her cheeks wore a rosy glow when she
faced her companions in the drawing room a moment later.</p>

<p>The Overland Riders smiled. They understood.</p>

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
